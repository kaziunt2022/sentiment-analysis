FAA-2014-0641-0011,"To Whom It May Concern: I would like to offer my comments in support of the Sky-Futures request for a Section 333 Exemption for the following reasons:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>1. Sky-Futures has developed a unique approach to safely inspecting such facilities at difficult to access locations on offshore oil and gas platforms, oil and gas processing plants, oil wells, and the supporting transportation support assets. Granting Sky-Futures to have a Section 333 Exemption would allow them to provide an innovative and cost effective approach to enhancing the safety processes and allow stricter safety compliance in the oil and gas industry by the Federal Government.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>2. The airspace required for this support is extremely limited to the appropriate facility being inspected, operates in a remote low altitude environment, and would have no apparent effect upon the National Airspace System.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>3. All Remote Pilots are trained Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) specialists who were highly trained by the Military and fully understand proper air space management.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>4.

FAA-2014-0641-0012,"Sky-Futures has a long track record of ensuring safety during their operations and will bring those same levels of safety to US operations. Due to the vehicles weight and low velocity, risk to local infrastructure and people are minimal and can be mitigated procedurally. These operation will help feed the FAA data on how to safely regulate operations on off-shore oil platforms which can lend itself to developing regulations for more densely packed environments.

FAA-2014-0641-0004,"My name is Lt Col Jason Forte and I am a MQ-1B Predator instructor pilot in the Texas National Guard.  I have been piloting the MQ-1B for eight years and have nearly 4,000 combat hours.  I also have my commercial and ATP licenses and 2,200 pilot in command hours in the Lear 35 and C-130 Hercules.  I have either been an instructor or evaluator pilot in all three platforms.<br/><br/>Sky-Futures has submitted a Section 333 Exemption letter to operate small unmanned aircraft systems in US airspace.  After thoroughly reviewing the exemption request, it has my full support.  <br/><br/>My two largest concerns when considering granting any type of exemption are training and safety of flight.<br/><br/>TRAINING<br/>I have met with Nicholas Rogers, the training and legislation director at Sky-Futures.  I reviewed all of the checklists and training syllabi for the AscTec Falcon 8 and it rivals any formal training course that the Air Force offers.  My formal training for the MQ-1B was four weeks.  This included system academics, basic aircraft control and employment of the hellfire missile.  The Predator is a much more complex system than the Falcon 8.  The Sky-Futures training syllabus is a three week training course.  Every ride has a clearly defined, detailed list of tasks that must be accomplished.  Sky-Futures also requires that the pilot in command either have a private pilots license or has completed FAA ground instruction and pass the FAA written examination.  Keep in mind that the pilot in command is never actually controlling any flight surfaces but rather making inputs to the autopilot system.<br/><br/>SAFETY OF FLIGHT<br/>The Falcon 8 will be operating in the offshore environment over and around platforms that are essentially private property.  When doing a hazard analysis of the offshore environment there are three main areas that should be addressed.  People working on the platform, ships surrounding the platform and arriving/departing helicopter traffic.  The risk analysis for these three areas is very LOW.  First and foremost, the mission time of the Falcon 8 is 15-20 minutes making it very easy to remove all ships and people from the area of the platform that is being inspected.  If this is not practical, then numerous announcements should be made over the platform communication system alerting the crew of inspection operations.  All members of the platform are required to wear proper safety equipment to include hardhat and protective eye ware.  Due to the known helicopter schedule, it is very easy to schedule inspections so as to never have a UAS and helicopter in the air at the same time.  As a failsafe, the pilot in command will monitor the appropriate radio frequency.  If a helicopter is inbound/outbound the proper coordination will take place.<br/><br/>Recently, the news has reported that the FAA will grant 333 exemptions to seven film companies allowing them to use drones for filming purposes.  This is a great stride forward for the small UAS.  All of the details are not released yet but it should be noted that platform inspections would most likely take place in more remote areas with less congestion.  Whatever the risk assessment is for the film and television UAS, the platform inspection risk will be equal to it or lower.<br/>",name lt col jason forte mq predator instructor pilot texas national guard piloting mq eight year nearly combat hour also commercial atp license pilot command hour lear hercules either instructor evaluator pilot three platform sky future submitted section exemption letter operate small unmanned aircraft system u airspace thoroughly reviewing exemption request full support two largest concern considering granting type exemption training safety flight trainingi met nicholas rogers training legislation director sky future reviewed checklist training syllabus asctec falcon rival formal training course air force offer formal training mq four week included system academic basic aircraft control employment hellfire missile predator much complex system falcon sky future training syllabus three week training course every ride clearly defined detailed list task must accomplished sky future also requires pilot command either private pilot license completed faa ground instruction pas faa written examination keep mind pilot command never actually controlling flight surface rather making input autopilot system safety flightthe falcon operating offshore environment around platform essentially private property hazard analysis offshore environment three main area addressed people working platform ship surrounding platform arriving departing helicopter traffic risk analysis three area low first foremost mission time falcon minute making easy remove ship people area platform inspected practical numerous announcement made platform communication system alerting crew inspection operation member platform required wear proper safety equipment include hardhat protective eye ware due known helicopter schedule easy schedule inspection never uas helicopter air time failsafe pilot command monitor appropriate radio frequency helicopter inbound outbound proper coordination take place recently news reported faa grant exemption seven film company allowing use drone filming purpose great stride forward small uas detail released yet noted platform inspection would likely take place remote area le congestion whatever risk assessment film television uas platform inspection risk equal lower,0.9607,Positive

FAA-2014-0641-0006,"Dear Sirs I am offering my comments in support of the Sky-Futures request for a Section 333 Exemption. <br/>I am a retired Vice President from ExxonMobil. During my career in the oil and gas industry safety was a primary concern. Routine inspection of operating equipment is vital to ensure safe operations. These inspections include pipelines, refinery equipment such as flares and pressure vessels, offshore platforms, remote gas separation plants, oil wells and gathering systems, ships, terminals, retail outlets and many other facilities. <br/>In order to conduct visual inspections the currently used technology frequently requires placing personnel in elevated or difficult positions to gain line of sight. <br/>Unmanned Aircraft Systems offer a safer, lower cost and more flexible process for providing external inspections. <br/>Sky-Futures has demonstrated success in these areas in other parts of the world. Allowing the company to operate in the USA will help support the oil and gas industry thus protecting the vital interests of the country.

FAA-2014-0641-0008,"I encourage the FAA to approve Sky-Futures&#39; Section 333 Exemption request to operate small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in US airspace.  Including Sky-Futures in the early stages as the FAA broadens commercial UAS use will be a public service in both expansion of veteran career opportunities and improved safety of dangerous infrastructure services.<br/><br/>It is critical that civilian organizations continue to provide veteran career opportunities.  Our military men and women serve this country proudly and helping them transfer that experience into civilian careers provides many benefits for both the individuals and companies that hire them.  Coming out of the US Air Force with Titan II missile experience, I well know the challenges of translating military specific skills into a civilian job.  I am encouraged to see Sky-Futures&#39; commitment to veterans with an employee makeup greater than 80% globally.   Opening the US market to Sky-Futures enables US veterans with military UAS experience to transfer these hard-earned skills into oil and gas, construction and utilities inspections.  <br/><br/>Sky-Futures has 5 years experience delivering commercial UAS inspections on dangerous infrastructure located in extreme and austere geographical environments with a proven record of improving safety.  Firstly by minimizing human risk on the actual inspections.  Secondly by allowing more thorough inspections of this type of infrastructure, providing more accurate data points to prevent future accidents.   This UAS use case is very different from existing use cases exempted by the FAA and will provide a much broader perspective for the safe integration of UAS into the National Airspace System allowing more comprehensive rule-making.  <br/><br/>Gracie Golonka<br/>US Air Force Veteran",encourage faa approve sky future section exemption request operate small unmanned aircraft system uas u airspace including sky future early stage faa broadens commercial uas use public service expansion veteran career opportunity improved safety dangerous infrastructure service critical civilian organization continue provide veteran career opportunity military men woman serve country proudly helping transfer experience civilian career provides many benefit individual company hire coming u air force titan ii missile experience well know challenge translating military specific skill civilian job encouraged see sky future commitment veteran employee makeup greater globally opening u market sky future enables u veteran military uas experience transfer hard earned skill oil gas construction utility inspection sky future year experience delivering commercial uas inspection dangerous infrastructure located extreme austere geographical environment proven record improving safety firstly minimizing human risk actual inspection secondly allowing thorough inspection type infrastructure providing accurate data point prevent future accident uas use case different existing use case exempted faa provide much broader perspective safe integration uas national airspace system allowing comprehensive rule making gracie golonkaus air force veteran,0.9801,Positive

CFPB-2018-0003-0367,"Feedback on Bureau (nonexistent) Enforcement  Process.  <br/><br/>It is a travesty &amp; waste of resources to pretend CFPB is doing anything, when current leadership is letting banks &amp; financial institutions get away with murder.  Millions of homes illegally foreclosed on.  MILLIONS of forged loan documents, to steal homes.  Our government even gave the big banks criminal immunity for &quot;Linda Green&quot; forged signatures. Meanwhile, families like mine suffer relentlessly.  WHY SHOULD MY FAMILY HAVE TO FIGHT BANKS FOR 11 YEARS THEN THEY USE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES &amp; PROFIT FROM STOLEN HOMES TO FIGHT US?  <br/><br/>You should be ashamed.  <br/><br/>These banks do not need protection.  Sadly, you must legislate morality because these banks have forgotten what ethics &amp; morality means.  Consider my family&#39;s story, which CFPB did nothing about, &amp; cannot-as even when banks respond with a lie to complaints you have no process to look further or take further action.  Inexcusable. <br/><br/>I spent 6 years fighting US Bank, after suing them for wrongful foreclosure, losing my home &amp; being forced to move, then a published appeal (Ragland V US Bank, Cal App 4th, 2012), &amp; finally getting to trial where they settled Day 1.  <br/><br/>Then-Wells Fargo illegally foreclosed on my rental, tried 4 years to evict me illegally despite a 5 year lease &amp; PTFA, &amp; finally withdrew when I proved they stole the loan/house. I spent $100K on attorneys, &amp; $300K+ on house repairs-plus my time &amp; employee time.  This house is so dangerous, it would be red tagged.  Wells Fargo admitted they don&#39;t know how they got a loan due to the state of the house-yet leaves my family here to pay for all their repairs, &amp; risk serious danger-despite geological reports showing the house is a &quot;danger to life and limb&quot;. <br/><br/>Wells Fargo/OCWEN do not care if we are KILLED in this house-then they would not have to pay me back!!!  Dispicable!!    <br/><br/>Wells Fargo/OCWEN did not follow Federal/state PTFA law.  Wells Fargo&#39;s executive office claims they don&#39;t have to. They do!  When we deposed them, they sent OCWEN who testified they have NO PROCESS TO HANDLE RENTERS IN A FORECLOSED PROPERTY.  They have no plans to follow the  law.  <br/><br/>I reported this to CFPB in 2014.  Wells Fargo said &quot;It&#39;s not us, it&#39;s OCWEN&quot;.  We tried for 3 years to depose Wells Fargo. They sent OCWEN Spring 2014,  who testified 17 times they were operating under Authority of WELLS FARGO.  I filed another CFPB complaint-pointing out Wells Fargo lied. Wells Fargo  responded to CFPB since I did not own the home, I don&#39;t &quot;have standing&quot;. Ridiculous. They sued me &quot;Wells Fargo v Ragland&quot;, &amp; I live in the  foreclosed house.  I have the right to bring a complaint about them not following PTFA laws impacting my family.    <br/><br/>They thumb their nose at the law.  <br/><br/>I replied to the closed CFPB complaint my complaint was not addressed. I called CFPB to see if I could appeal with a human-you used to be able to. Now you cannot. What good is CFPB, if the bank lies and then the complaint is closed?  It  serves absolutely no value.  None. If you do nothing, just close.  <br/><br/>I submitted another complaint!!  There is no spot for renter complaints on foreclosures on your site. You need to have an  &quot;other&quot; category.  <br/><br/>Wells Fargo replied to that one after 15 days, that they needed  60 more days.  Why? This is not hard--they broke the law and  they owe me money. End  of story.  They are  only  doing this because I told them I  would keep submitting complaints.  <br/><br/>What good are these CFPB complaints?  These banks are doing whatever they want, running amuck... After my family being impacted for more than 11 years now--I am getting pretty tired of it.  My son was not born yet when my loan was forged in 2002.  My kids were 4  &amp; 5  when US Bank put my home in foreclosure wrongly, starting in 2007, &amp; 6 &amp; 7 when we were forced to move from my home of 19 years I bought new, in 2009.  That is the biggest trauma my family has ever been through,being forced from the only home my kids ever knew &amp; causing my son to become Autistic.  Here we are -- my kids are almost 16 &amp; 17... &amp; we are STILL FIGHTING BANKS.  When does this madness end?  WHY SHOULD MY KIDS HAVE  TO SPEND THEIR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD FIGHTING BANKS?  <br/><br/>WHY CAN&#39;T YOU DO YOUR JOB?  <br/><br/>If there is no accountability when banks do bogus replies, no way to find the right issue category, &amp; no penalty to these banks -- what good is your agency?  I would like to see you do some good.  <br/><br/>Suggestions -- <br/>1) Banks need more regulation not less <br/>2) Allow a way to &quot;appeal with a human&quot; when an institution does not actually address the issue.  <br/>3) Have a process so the human who is appealed to can actually do something to stop this issue from happening again.   Penalties.  Referring for further action.  SOMETHIING.  DO SOMETHING.  <br/>4) Impose penalties on these banks, and stick to them.  Hit them where it hurts... their pocketbook.  These penalties should be based on actual customer reports.   <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>",feedback bureau nonexistent enforcement process travesty amp waste resource pretend cfpb anything current leadership letting bank amp financial institution get away murder million home illegally foreclosed million forged loan document steal home government even gave big bank criminal immunity quot linda green quot forged signature meanwhile family like mine suffer relentlessly family fight bank year use government resource amp profit stolen home fight u ashamed bank need protection sadly must legislate morality bank forgotten ethic amp morality mean consider family story cfpb nothing amp even bank respond lie complaint process look take action inexcusable spent year fighting u bank suing wrongful foreclosure losing home amp forced move published appeal ragland u bank cal app amp finally getting trial settled day well fargo illegally foreclosed rental tried year evict illegally despite year lease amp ptfa amp finally withdrew proved stole loan house spent attorney amp house repair plus time amp employee time house dangerous would red tagged well fargo admitted know got loan due state house yet leaf family pay repair amp risk serious danger despite geological report showing house quot danger life limb quot well fargo ocwen care killed house would pay back dispicable well fargo ocwen follow federal state ptfa law well fargo executive office claim deposed sent ocwen testified process handle renter foreclosed property plan follow law reported cfpb well fargo said quot u ocwen quot tried year depose well fargo sent ocwen spring testified time operating authority well fargo filed another cfpb complaint pointing well fargo lied well fargo responded cfpb since home quot standing quot ridiculous sued quot well fargo ragland quot amp live foreclosed house right bring complaint following ptfa law impacting family thumb nose law replied closed cfpb complaint complaint addressed called cfpb see could appeal human used able good cfpb bank lie complaint closed serf absolutely value none nothing close submitted another complaint spot renter complaint foreclosure site need quot quot category well fargo replied one day needed day hard broke law owe money end story told would keep submitting complaint good cfpb complaint bank whatever want running amuck family impacted year getting pretty tired son born yet loan forged kid amp u bank put home foreclosure wrongly starting amp amp forced move home year bought new biggest trauma family ever forced home kid ever knew amp causing son become autistic kid almost amp amp still fighting bank madness end kid spend entire childhood fighting bank job accountability bank bogus reply way find right issue category amp penalty bank good agency would like see good suggestion bank need regulation le allow way quot appeal human quot institution actually address issue process human appealed actually something stop issue happening penalty referring action somethiing something impose penalty bank stick hit hurt pocketbook penalty based actual customer report thank,-0.9974,Negative

As such, KASPICK &amp; COMPANY is intimately familiar with the four-tier accounting, tax reporting, and investment applications of existing laws and actively monitors proposed laws and regulations in the field.  It is with this professional knowledge background that we submit the following.  <br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We urge Treasury to omit the elective method under Proposed Regulation Section 1.1411-3(d)(3) from the final regulations of Section 1411.  While we recognize and thank the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service for considering this alternative elective method to the category and class methodology under section 664 to track distributable net investment income (NII), we believe allowing an election will unnecessarily complicate trust administration for trustees and their service providers, increase confusion and uncertainty among beneficiaries, and lead to an increase in the time and resources the IRS will need to devote to ensure compliance and tax administration with regard to charitable remainder trusts and the NII.<br/>&emsp;<br/>The option to elect between the 664 method and the proposed elective method will introduce complexities in trust administration that will be burdensome in terms of the time and effort spent by trustees and their service providers.  For example, if the election is permitted, trustees operating under the Section 1.1411-3(d)(2) method may succeed as trustees to other charitable remainder trusts operating under the elective method of Proposed Regulation Section 1.1411-3(d)(3).  This introduces a new level of recordkeeping and compliance hurdles for trustees and administrators succeeding to these trusts, particularly because an election is irrevocable once made.  Successor trustees will be required to learn and apply an entirely different and non-complementary accounting system to their existing method under section 664.  Trustees and administrators would need to decide whether to only serve as trustee/administrator of trusts that originally adopted the succeeding trustee/administrator&rsquo;s preferred method, or learn and develop time-consuming and expensive processes and procedures and develop multiple systems capabilities in order to apply an entirely separate and non-complementary process to track, distribute and report NII.  Permitting only the Section 1.1411-3(d)(2)  method of tracking distributable NII under the four-tier accounting structure of Section 664 will help eliminate these and other concerns and lead to less confusion among the various parties.  <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Furthermore, allowing an election increases the knowledge requirements necessary for non-professional trustees to perform correct calculations and tracking of NII and this unnecessarily complicates the tax filing and administration of CRTs for any future successor trustees and administrators.  In addition, requiring trustees to elect between two vastly different methods will impose the onus on them to justify the election choice to income beneficiaries.  <br/><br/>Finally, including the alternative method under Proposed Regulation Section 1.1411-3(d)(3) will not simplify tax administration responsibilities for the IRS nor will it result in higher Treasury revenue. However, permitting only a single method will simplify tax administration for the IRS, as only the method contained in Section 1.1411-3(d)(2) will need to be monitored, and the application of the Section 1.411-3(d)(2) method will result in substantially the same revenue for Treasury.  Therefore, permitting only one method will produce no material loss in revenue and provides administrative simplicity to all parties.  <br/><br/>We respectfully submit the foregoing comments for Treasury&rsquo;s consideration prior to issuing final regulations on Section 1411. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Lindy Sherwood<br/>President and Senior Managing Director <br/>Kaspick &amp; Company<br/>",march management budgetattn desk officer department treasury office information regulatory affair washington dc internal revenue service attn irs report clearance officerse car mp spwashington dc rulemaking portal www regulation gov comment pursuant paperwork reduction act regarding application section charitable remainder trust reg regulation direct net investment income charitable remainder trust shall tracked distributed following four tier accounting structure section adopted treasury regulation section omit elective method contained proposed treasury regulation section final regulation dear sir madam kaspick amp company leading provider planned gift investment management administrative service including service charitable remainder trust count many nation rsquo top educational social service organization among client kaspick amp company intimately familiar four tier accounting tax reporting investment application existing law actively monitor proposed law regulation field professional knowledge background submit following urge treasury omit elective method proposed regulation section final regulation section recognize thank treasury internal revenue service considering alternative elective method category class methodology section track distributable net investment income nii believe allowing election unnecessarily complicate trust administration trustee service provider increase confusion uncertainty among beneficiary lead increase time resource irs need devote ensure compliance tax administration regard charitable remainder trust nii emsp option elect method proposed elective method introduce complexity trust administration burdensome term time effort spent trustee service provider example election permitted trustee operating section method may succeed trustee charitable remainder trust operating elective method proposed regulation section introduces new level recordkeeping compliance hurdle trustee administrator succeeding trust particularly election irrevocable made successor trustee required learn apply entirely different non complementary accounting system existing method section trustee administrator would need decide whether serve trustee administrator trust originally adopted succeeding trustee administrator rsquo preferred method learn develop time consuming expensive process procedure develop multiple system capability order apply entirely separate non complementary process track distribute report nii permitting section method tracking distributable nii four tier accounting structure section help eliminate concern lead le confusion among various party furthermore allowing election increase knowledge requirement necessary non professional trustee perform correct calculation tracking nii unnecessarily complicates tax filing administration crt future successor trustee administrator addition requiring trustee elect two vastly different method impose onus justify election choice income beneficiary finally including alternative method proposed regulation section simplify tax administration responsibility irs result higher treasury revenue however permitting single method simplify tax administration irs method contained section need monitored application section method result substantially revenue treasury therefore permitting one method produce material loss revenue provides administrative simplicity party respectfully submit foregoing comment treasury rsquo consideration prior issuing final regulation section sincerely lindy sherwoodpresident senior managing director kaspick amp company,0.9987,Positive

IRS-2013-0042-0002,"<br/>Gentlemen,<br/><br/>Proposed Regulation 1.411-4(d)(4) contains an example of the capital loss carryover adjustment   The last sentence dealing with the explanation of the amount of capital loss that is deductible for net investment income purposes is $1,000.<br/>This is the correct amount that is deductible. However the explanation for its deductibility reads that it is $1,000  because the loss is less than the allowable loss for Chapter 1 purposes of $3,000.I believe that this explanation is incorrect or at best inconsistent with example 3 of Final Regulation 1.1411-4(f)(4). In that example the amount of investment capital loss is $15,000 and the taxpayer has a nonnet investment income capital gain of $21,000, In that example the taxpayer is able to deduct $15,000 of the Sec. 1411 capital loss in computing net investment income.since it was deductible in computing taxable income for Chapter 1 purposes.  To be consistent with that example, the proposed regulation should state that the amount is $8,000 instead of $3,000. The $8,000 represents the $5,000 of capital losses used to offset the $5,000 in current year capital gain plus the $3,000 that was allowed as a deduction in computing Chapter 1 taxable income.<br/><br/>Below is a portion of the proposed regulation in question as well the pertinent part of the Final Reg. Sec. 1411-4(f)(4).<br/><br/>(D) The amount of capital loss carryover that is taken into account by A in computing net investment income in Year 3 is $0 ($9,000 carryover amount less the adjustment of $9,000). Accordingly, when calculating net investment income, A excludes $5,000 of gain under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and the $9,000 capital loss carryover under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. The amount of losses taken into account for purposes of computing net gain is $1,000 (attributable to the $1,000 short-term capital loss from the disposition of publicly traded stock). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, A is entitled to a deduction of $1,000 because the $1,000 capital loss exceeds the gains, and the loss is less than the amount of allowable loss for chapter 1 purposes ($3,000).<br/><br/>Reg. Sec. 1.411-4 Definition of net investment income.<br/><br/>(f) Properly allocable deductions&mdash;<br/><br/>(4) Loss deductions&mdash;(i) General rule. Losses described in section 165, whether described in section 62 or section 63(d), are allowed as properly allocable deductions to the extent such losses exceed the amount of gain described in section 61(a)(3) and are not taken into account in computing net gain by reason of paragraph (d) of this section.<br/><br/>(ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f)(4). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:<br/><br/>Example 3. (i) In Year 1, B, an unmarried individual, incurs a short-term capital loss of $15,000 on the sale of publicly traded stocks. B also receives annuity income of $50,000. In addition, B disposes of property used in his sole proprietorship (which is not a trade or business described in section 1411(c)(2) or &sect;1.1411-5(a) for a gain of $21,000. Pursuant to section 1231, the gain of $21,000 is treated as a long-term capital gain for purposes of chapter 1. B has no capital losses carried over from a preceding year.<br/><br/>(ii) For purposes of chapter 1, B includes the $50,000 of annuity income in the computation of adjusted gross income. The $21,000 long-term capital gain is offset by the $15,000 short-term capital loss, so B includes $6,000 of net long-term capital gain in the computation of adjusted gross income.<br/>",gentleman proposed regulation contains example capital loss carryover adjustment last sentence dealing explanation amount capital loss deductible net investment income purpose correct amount deductible however explanation deductibility read loss le allowable loss chapter purpose believe explanation incorrect best inconsistent example final regulation example amount investment capital loss taxpayer nonnet investment income capital gain example taxpayer able deduct sec capital loss computing net investment income since deductible computing taxable income chapter purpose consistent example proposed regulation state amount instead represents capital loss used offset current year capital gain plus allowed deduction computing chapter taxable income portion proposed regulation question well pertinent part final reg sec amount capital loss carryover taken account computing net investment income year carryover amount le adjustment accordingly calculating net investment income excludes gain paragraph section capital loss carryover paragraph iii section amount loss taken account purpose computing net gain attributable short term capital loss disposition publicly traded stock pursuant paragraph section entitled deduction capital loss exceeds gain loss le amount allowable loss chapter purpose reg sec definition net investment income properly allocable deduction mdash loss deduction mdash general rule loss described section whether described section section allowed properly allocable deduction extent loss exceed amount gain described section taken account computing net gain reason paragraph section ii example following example illustrate provision paragraph purpose example assume taxpayer united state citizen us calendar taxable year year subsequent year taxable year section effect example year unmarried individual incurs short term capital loss sale publicly traded stock also receives annuity income addition disposes property used sole proprietorship trade business described section sect gain pursuant section gain treated long term capital gain purpose chapter capital loss carried preceding year ii purpose chapter includes annuity income computation adjusted gross income long term capital gain offset short term capital loss includes net long term capital gain computation adjusted gross income,0.8442,Positive

In addition the taxpayer is in the same income tax position as the rental activity is generally deemed non-passive under the &sect;469 regulations for self-rented property.  However, starting in 2013, the self-rental places the taxpayer in a detrimental position under &sect;1411.  Presently there is no clear mechanism in the proposed regulations for netting the rental income and the offsetting rental expense from separate related-entities for purposes of determining net investment income under &sect;1411.  Thus the taxpayer is forced to either reduce or eliminate the rental income, or restructure the ownership of the property to avoid the &sect;1411 tax.  The taxpayer has valid non-tax reasons for the structure and relationship between the related entities, and will be forced to alter the structure and relationship under the current rules (&ldquo;tax tail wagging the dog&rdquo;).<br/> <br/>A similar whipsaw effect under the passive activity rules was addressed in Regs. &sect;1.469-7, where self-charged interest income is recharacterized from portfolio income to passive activity income in order to offset the interest expense from a passive activity.  This sensible rule puts the taxpayer back in the same tax position as if the interest had not been charged, and thus does not let tax law distort business decisions.

IRS-2012-0049-0016,"For purposes of 1411, there are two tests that must be met for income to not be subject to this tax.  One is not passive under 469 and the other one is it must be derived in a trade or business.  The first test is relatively easy to deal with. The 2nd test is problematic as you already know. THere are two specific situations under 469 that take normally passive income and cause it to be non-passive.  The first is the real estate professional exception.  The second is the self rental exception.  In the REP exception, it would seem that rental activities could rise to the level of a trade or business,very much subject to interpretation by taxpayers and the IRS.  In the second case, the rental property is so closely tied to the operating entity that rents from it, but probably never comes close to being a trade or business on its own.   In the self rental situation, the real estate is owned outside the operating entity for a variety of non-tax reasons.  In many cases it&#39;s the owner of the operating business paying himself rent, and in the mean time, costs 3.8% more in tax. That is how many taxpayers have their business structured, unfortunately.   I suggest that if either one of these exceptions kick in under 469 to cause something to be non-passive, that they are also found to be automatically trade or business under 1411.

This comment relates to paragraph (2) of subsection (j) that permits the substitution of merchandise for imported merchandise for the purposes of the exportation or destruction requirement.  The National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) is a Washington, DC-based trade association representing United States-based importers of wine, beer and spirits.  Our comment is made on behalf of several of our members who import significant volumes of wine for sale in the United States market.  <br/><br/>The intent of the rulemaking to reject claims for drawback of tax under paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of the Tariff Act of 1930, if in fact no tax was paid on the domestically produced wine being substituted, is sound.  In fact, the refund of up to 99% of the excise tax collected by the Department of the Treasury to drawback claimants seems to be incompatible with the true intent of the substitution drawback provision.  Conversely, in cases where importers/domestic producers pay excise taxes, duty or tariff either on product entry or domestic production, there is a fair basis to refund those costs by substitution drawback following export or destruction.  This valid process should clearly continue and not be affected by any amendments provided for in this rulemaking.  <br/><br/>While NABI agrees with the recommended changes to the regulations at 27 CFR part 28 to restrict the substitution drawback as set forth therein, our members also understand the arguments of the proponents of the current structure.  Namely, that permitting unfettered substitution drawback enhances the ability of domestic products to compete in markets where entry duties or fees drive up the cost of goods.  However, there should be other more just and direct methods to deal with unfair entry duties than continuing with what amounts to a subsidy for those particular importers/domestic producers who are in a position to take advantage of this provision.  Importers/domestic producers who cannot participate in the present substitution drawback process find themselves competing in a business environment unfairly tilted in favor of exporters who have received a 99% refund of their federal excise tax.  In addition, the refunded drawback represents revenue that should remain with Treasury to fund the significant budgetary challenges that currently face America.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, the NABI members mentioned above support the proposed amendments to the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify how substitution drawback is interpreted and applied.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>[Electronically signed]<br/><br/>William T.

TTB-2009-0005-0021,"Dear Mr. Isenberg:<br/>On behalf of Hahn Family Wines (&ldquo;Winery&rdquo;), I am writing to oppose the US Customs and Border Protection (&ldquo;CBP&rdquo;) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Drawback of Internal Revenue Excise Tax (&ldquo;Proposed Rule&rdquo;). See 74 Fed Reg 52937 (October 15, 2009).<br/>We are a family wine operation that has grown due to producing consumer friendly wines and employing a marketing program that gets our wine out in front of the consumer. We see growth potential in the international marketplace. Our efforts have led us to drawback which is a key component of our export growth. Drawback will allow the winery to increase production to fill international sales. That growth benefits not only the Winery but also many small businesses that provide our bottles, labels, closures and many other services making up the California wine industry.<br/>The Winery strongly opposes the Proposed Rule as it is contrary to the statute authorizing drawback. If implemented, it will significantly damage our wine export program. Since 2009 we&rsquo;ve strategically enhanced our export program, encouraged by our ability to claim drawback. The increase in export sales allows us to purchase more California wine grapes, produce more wine, and enhance the image of US wine worldwide.<br/>Our success is despite fact we compete against highly subsidized foreign producers. In 2008 the European Commission gave nearly 800 Million EUR to European wine producers. By 2013, the total funding will be over 5 Billion EUR. It is also difficult to compete in markets such as Japan, China, and Korea, where competitors benefit from free trade agreements. The expanded export of U.S. wines has been championed by Congress since the 1984 Wine Equity and Export Expansion Act. Drawback of duty and excise taxes on wine furthers that Congressional intent.<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments.

There are not nearly enough data or studies, particularly social data such as the kind you are collecting, addressing this topic, and therefore you are addressing a significant need. Your survey results will be extremely helpful in informing management decisions and particularly how we allocate limited resources to address coastal water quality problems. <br/><br/>Your two surveys are very well designed and I offer just a few minor/specific suggestions in the interest of improving them. I hope these suggestions will help improve your survey response rate and the quality of data you collect.<br/><br/>For both surveys:<br/><br/>1. Your survey design is busy and very overwhelming visually. I worry this will affect your response rate. Can you introduce more white/dead space on each page? Maybe use fewer boxes? Question numbering also overwhelming, can you simplify? (why &quot;3.16.A&quot; why not just 1, 2, 3, 4....)<br/><br/>2. In your Likert scale questions about the importance of place - What about places connected with &quot;important memories&quot; that are not family related? I have a lot of those and am sure I&#39;m not alone. Can you make the question more general?<br/><br/>3. In your transportation questions - change &quot;airplane&quot; to something more general that includes both planes and helicopters. A fair number of coastal recreators use helicopters to travel between locations.<br/><br/>For the general recreation survey:<br/><br/>1. Use of term &quot;fin fishing&quot; - in our experience this term is not understood by a lay audience to be as general as I think you mean it. Suggest simplifying to just fishing.<br/><br/>For the shellfishing survey:<br/><br/>1. You are using the term shellfish to address crustaceans too (lobsters, crabs). In our professional experience we have found this distracting to those who know that shellfish and crustaceans are different. Can you define the term &quot;recreational shellfishing&quot; early in the survey to make clear that this is shorthand for broader suite of activities?<br/><br/>2. Why at some point do you start excluding lobsters? I found it distracting. Can you explain this in the survey somewhere?<br/><br/>Best of luck to you in your survey administration and your research more broadly.

EPA-HQ-ORD-2016-0632-0029,"The immensity of greenhouse gas emissions from California wildfires has been a warning for years. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex of old trees, dead bushes, etc, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. If managed wisely, and remove the environmental activists that has stop forest personal from cutting old growth.  America&#39;s national forests can provide clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and abundant domestic supplies of wood products and support rural communities and thousands of jobs in the timber industry. Clearly, we must make every effort to reduce the amount of excess biomass in forests to prevent catastrophic wildfires. That means decreasing the number of trees by thinning to make them more resistant to crown fires, which will also restore the natural health and diversity of our forests. Reducing the number and severity of wildfires may be the single most important action we can take in the short-term to lower greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. The catastrophic wildfires that ravage California each year don&#39;t resemble the historic fires that took place in these forests for millennia.  Just too many over grown bushes and trees. They exceed emissions that would have occurred in historic fires because the biomass available to burn is so much greater than it was in natural forests. Consequently wildfires, when the massive amounts of fuel in these forests burned, they released an estimated 9.5 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere just from combustion. That is an average of about 63 tons per acre. However, combustion is only part of the story because dead trees also gradually release CO2 as they decay. CO2 emissions from decay are generally three times greater than emissions from combustion because large quantities of wood and other plant material remain unburned after a forest fire.   Combining combustion and decay emissions.  Estimates that fires will emit a staggering 38 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Fires released one fourth of the gases during combustion, and post-fire decay will release the remainder during the next 100 years, most of it during the next 50 years. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. California should be required to limit wildfire NOx emissions to reduce ozone, and to limit annual NOx and SO2 emissions to reduce fine particle pollution.  Mercury emissions from forest fires (QHg) (in kg of mercury per year) can be estimated following a bottom-up approach by the equation: contribute substantial emissions of gases and particles to the atmosphere. <br/>Over the years, outside the regulatory process, well-funded special interest groups have use  lawsuits to force federal agencies  to issue regulations that advance their priorities. At some point, this exercise of &quot;Sue-and-Settle&quot; and the practice of acquiescence through consent decrees or settlement agreements, which were often crafted behind closed doors and without the transparency of the rulemaking process, became all too common, paying tens of thousands of dollars in attorney&#39;s fees to these groups with which were settled. More transparent process in which impacted parties and states have a voice and creates more awareness for the general public is needed.

For too long, we&#39;ve been held back by burdensome oil and gas regulations,  Sound oil and gas energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America.  Domestic oil and gas from  BLM lands energy policies will lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages.

Not all controlled lands are open to leasing now. CBO estimates that, under current laws 2012 and policies, the government&#39;s gross proceeds from all federal oil and gas leases on public lands will total about......... $150 billion over the next decade.....( Before oil and gas regulations currently) ........CBO estimated that about 70 percent of undiscovered oil and gas resources are on federal lands that are available for leasing. How Much Would the Government Collect from Opening ANWR to Development?  CBO expects that opening ANWR to development would yield about $5 billion in additional receipts over the next 10 years, primarily in the form of bonus payments made by private firms for the opportunity to explore for and develop resources in particular areas. Because extraction is currently prohibited, the receipts from leasing in ANWR could not be realized under current law. Between 50 percent and 90 percent of those receipts would be paid to the state of Alaska, if specifications in the authorizing legislation were similar to those in recent legislation. gross royalties from leasing in ANWR would probably total between $25 billion and $50 billion (in 2010 dollars) during the 2023-2035 period, or roughly $2 billion to $4 billion a year. <br/>Congressional Budget Office   2012 Report Opening Most Federal Lands to Oil and Gas    How Much Would the Government Collect from Opening Other Federal Lands? CBO anticipates that new legislation directing the Department of the Interior to immediately offer most other federal lands for oil and gas leasing without any restrictions would accelerate the collection of around $2 billion of future leasing receipts into the next decade. Most of that revenue would come from OCS leases; a portion of those proceeds would be shared with state governments. <br/>Congressional Budget Office 2016  report  Domestic oil and gas production occurring on federal lands or in federal waters off the coast of the United States represented about one-fifth of total U.S. production in 2014. The firms that receive those rights to produce oil and gas make payments to the federal government, which distributes some of the money to states; over the 2005-2014 period, those payments averaged $11 billion per year.<br/>Congressional Budget Office    in 2014  before the rule,<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>report  How Will Shale Development Affect the Federal Budget?  The increase in GDP resulting from shale development has increased federal tax revenues, and it will continue to do so. That increase will be slightly larger than the GDP increase in percentage terms, CBO expects. Specifically,  CBO estimates that federal tax revenues will be about three-quarters of 1 percent (or about $35 billion) higher in 2020. Shale production also contributes to federal receipts through payments that the developers of federally owned resources make to the government. CBO estimates that federal royalties from shale (minus the amounts that the federal government transfers to the states) will be about $300 million annually by 2020.

Rescind or suspend  the Endangered Species Act, Environmental Activist  are using to stop America economy growth,  is way out of control.    There are few state levee safety programs and NO recognized standards at the national level for those programs. In the absence of effective regulatory regimes at the state level (comparable to the ones at the state level for non-federal dams), the repair and rebuilding of many locally owned levees after a flood often falls on the Federal government and the U.S. taxpayer. Title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, and section 3106 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, may provide a way to address this concern. A primary purpose of these provisions was to build capabilities within the states for MORE DAMS for levee safety, as well as to develop national guidelines and align federal programs.  June 2008, the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids, Iowa crested more than 11 feet above any previous floods at 31 feet. The flood waters covered 10 square miles14 percent of our city. 6865 residential properties, 754 commercial and industrial properties and 310 City facilities were damaged totaling more than $5.4 Billion in losses. This flood devastated  residents, businesses and entire community.  Recent natural weather events in the last month in California and other western states are highlighting the need to focus  attention on levees and dams, and other structures, that prevent catastrophic flooding and HELP FIGHT FIRES,  in both rural and urban communities. More than 180,000 people were evacuated in California because storms caused serious damage to the Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in the United States. Any future severe weather event could make this situation even more critical, and it is raising questions about the DAM readiness of our flood prevention infrastructure. Dams and levees across the country NEED to be modernized and maintained if we are to prevent future disasters Dams and levees and out of control wildfires, DAMS across the country need to be modernized and maintained if we are to prevent future disasters... RECREATION;  Dams provide prime recreational facilities throughout the United States. Boating, skiing, camping, picnic areas, and boat launch facilities are all supported by dams. FLOOD CONTROL;  In addition to helping farmers, dams help prevent the loss of life and property caused by flooding. Flood control dams impound floodwaters and then either release them under control to the river below the dam or store or divert the water for other uses. For centuries, people have built dams to help control devastating floods. WATER STORAGE ;  (Fire &amp; Farm Ponds) Dams create reservoirs throughout the United States that supply water for many uses, including industrial, municipal, and agricultural.  MINE TAILINGS; (help with clean water ) There are more than 1,300 mine tailings impoundments in the United States that allow the mining and processing of coal and other vital minerals while protecting the environment.  IRRIGATION ; Ten percent of American cropland is irrigated using water stored behind dams.  Thousands of JOBS  are tied to producing crops grown with irrigated water. ELECTRICAL GENERATION ; The United States is one of the largest producers of hydropower in the world, second only to Canada. Dams produce over 103,800 megawatts of renewable electricity and meet 8 to 12 percent of the Nation&#39;s power needs. Hydropower is considered clean because it does not contribute to global warming, air pollution, acid rain, or ozone depletion. DEBRIS CONTROL (CLEAN WATER) ; In some instances, dams provide enhanced environmental protection, such as the retention of hazardous materials and detrimental sedimentation.

EPA-HQ-ORD-2016-0632-0013,"Government Regulation agencies should be courageous in goal to reduce the burdens on the American People,  by  transparency,  insist on truth, objectivity, and demand sound science from Environmentalist ( political )  activists when making rules.  Truth in science doesn&#39;t depend on human consensus or political correctness. The fact that the majority of journalists, elite and pundits bray like sheep and try public shaming is meaningless.  Galileo, another &quot;social dinosaur,&quot; said &quot;the crowd of fools who know nothing is infinite skepticism is the first step towards truth. AGENCY SHOULD USE CAUTION IN DEVELOPING REGULATIONS DESIGNED BY ACTIVISTS  TO PUT AMERICAN BUSINESS, FARMERS, INDUSTURIAL, FACTORY, OIL, GAS,  RETAIL OUT OF BUSINESS.  The media hysteria on GOLBAL WARMING has been generated by ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST, carried into the street by sheep carrying signs, echoed  by leaders and news ,  who don&#39;t understand the provisional and uncertain nature of scientific knowledge. Science changes.  <br/>EXAMPLE : For years we were told that drinking coffee was bad for our health and would increase our risk for heart disease. But more recent studies have shown that not only is coffee safe for our hearts, it can decrease the risk of liver cancer and is chock full of healthy antioxidants.<br/>EXAMPLE: Article by an economist  temperatures are now higher than at any time in the past 12,000 years. The fact that the thermometer wasn&#39;t invented until the year 1714 ought to give us pause when evaluating this remarkable claim. Reconstructions of past temperatures are not measurements, but estimates. These estimates are based on innumerable interpretations and uncertain assumptions, all invisible to someone who only reads the headline. Better studies -- completely ignored by the major media -- have shown that late-twentieth-century temperatures are not anomalous or unusually warm.<br/>EXAMPLE OF SHAMING:   Consensus&quot; is another word for clique science. The good people are true believers, the bad people exhibit a &quot;will to disbelieve.&quot; Editors used to salute healthy skepticism. Now some are global-warming Torquemada.<br/>EXAMPLE :  A major researcher working in the area of climate change said,   the factual record needed to be altered so that people would become alarmed over global warming. He said, &quot;We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.&quot; How CORRUPT AND IDEOLOGICALLY driven current climate research can be.<br/>USE OF LOGIC  meteorologists can&#39;t predict what the temperature will be in 30 days. How is it that we are supposed to believe that they can reliably forecast what the temperature will be in 50 years? They can&#39;t, because Earth&#39;s climate system is complex and poorly understood.<br/>USE OF LOGIC  Copenhagen Consensus, a group of scientists and economists that looks at the best way to spend a hypothetical $50 billion to benefit mankind, rated fighting global warming as a &quot;bad&quot; use of money. <br/>USE OF LOGIC  GLOBAL WARMING is a religion, not science. That&#39;s why acolytes in the media attack global-warming critics, not with scientific arguments, but for their apostasy.<br/>One of the common claims in support of the reality and seriousness of global warming is that we have had a large portion of record breaking warm years during the last decade or so. This is not a claim used by the IPCC, and its presence in any discussion is a rather clear piece of evidence of the intent TO DECEIVE, especially when the claim is made by a scientist. As noted by Solow and Broadus (1989) and Bassett (1992), this is an inevitable occurrence when one has a single record breaker in a time series characterized by inter-annual variability, inter-decadal variability and an underlying trend or longer period variability. Solow and Broadus show the clustered nature of record breakers. For those who can follow some mathematics, the situation is easily synthesized. where the first term corresponds to interannual variability, the second term to interdecadal variability, and third to longer term trends or variability. Not surprisingly, record breakers cluster in exactly the manner found by Solow and Broadus (1989) in the observed temperature record. The occurrence of such record breakers contributes NO additional information. Our prime concern remains with the determination of trend and the identification of such trends with emissions of carbon dioxide, and this remains a difficult and contested issue as the IPCC freely acknowledges.

EPA-HQ-ORD-2016-0632-0025,"Impact of California wildfires on the atmosphere is out of control , thousands of tons of greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollutants, why does California continue to blame other sources of emissions, and why did the past administration report not include Co2 from wildfires in ozone emissions?? Wildfires produce more greenhouse gas (GHG ) pollutants than hundreds of thousand of cars or gas and oil or mining operations. Wildfires particles pollute our lakes and rivers  and prevent clean waters.    Agencies need to re think the emissions standards sources.A lack of active management has left our forests overly dense and stocked with dead and dying trees that feed catastrophic wildfires, Inability of the Forest Service to thin forests due to overly cumbersome and lengthy environmental activist processes, increasing frivolous lawsuits filed by certain litigious environmental activist , and a lack of sufficient agency focus on this challenge has led to millions acres with millions of dead trees and bushes. that are at high risk of deadly and catastrophic forest fires that endanger communities, hurt local economies, destroy land and water quality and release massive amounts of emissions into the atmosphere. Environmental litigation that has bogged down thinning projects for nearly two decades. Enough is enough. NEED federal review on the impact of wildfires on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, as well as the threat to habitat, water quality and property destruction. We can do things about forest management that make sense so we can diminish forest fires for the future, As management decreases, forest health deteriorates and fires grow in size, density and cost. How many more thousands of acres through the West must burn before we act? Need to figure out ways to clear the dense thicket of litigation and regulation that has for years stalled projects aimed at cutting back the federal forests, many plagued with diseased and dying trees. A lack of active management has left our forests overly dense and stocked with dead and dying trees that feed catastrophic wildfires, As management decreases, forest health deteriorates and fires grow in size, density and cost. The reignited debate comes as the Forest Service, which falls under the Agriculture Department, has watched its firefighting expenses soar, jumping from 15 to 55 percent of the budget and forcing cutbacks in areas such as facility maintenance and recreation. we can affect how we manage these forests to reduce the impact of forest fire.

EPA-HQ-ORD-2016-0632-0030,"Past EPA studies ignores the loss of jobs caused by higher electricity prices and reduced business competitiveness. Other assessments show job losses in the range of 180,000-215,000 in 2015 alone and 50,000- 85,000 in later years.23 Thus, EPA&#39;s failure to consider the full scope of the economic costs associated with its proposal has caused it to dramatically underestimate those costs. Past EPA conducted only a limited analysis of the employment impact of its Utility MATS Rule in the electricity sector. Past EPA acknowledged that it performed an evaluation of some costs in its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), but admits that it intentionally ignored the RIA in determining whether regulating EGUs is &quot;appropriate&quot; under Section 112. Even if EPA had considered the RIA, its cost evaluation was wholly inadequate. In the RIA, Past  EPA limited its consideration of costs to those arising directly in the utility sector - and arbitrarily to exclude even readily measurable economy-wide employment effects and other impacts caused by increased electricity prices. Past EPA&#39;s cost estimate of $9.6 billion for the Utility MATS Rule is confined to estimated compliance costs, Past EPA Final Rule, 77 Fed. Reg. at 9,306, 9,425, not a full analysis of the Rule&#39;s economic impact. But the evidence indicates that the economic effect of the Rule will be much broader than past EPA&#39;s &quot;cost&quot; analysis would indicate. <br/>The Regulation would causes the shut-down of coal-fired plants, reduce electric reliability, and increase retail electricity prices. These economic burdens will be imposed on consumers of electricity, including businesses, and will ultimately translate into higher costs for consumer goods and services and reduced employment.  Past EPA did not take any of these &quot;ripple&quot; effects into account, even though it recognized that the Utility MATS Rule &quot;is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy,&quot; id. at 9,441, and estimated that the Rule will increase the average nationwide retail electricity prices by 3.1 percent in 2015. Id. at 9,425. Other studies put the estimated price increase much higher, at 12-24 percent.21 Federal officials have warned that the Rule threatens the reliability of the electrical grid by causing plants to shut down. <br/>Regulatory actions increasing the price of electricity will lead to unemployment, reduced business competitiveness, and hardship for consumers. Studies have found that a 10 percent increase in electricity prices will result in a one percent reduction in GDP and employment level. The regulatory costs that Past EPA seeks to ignore are not simply a matter of concern to the industry within the agency&#39;s cross-hairs. These costs have substantial negative impacts on public health and welfare. In short, by focusing solely on compliance costs, Past EPA irrationally excludes the far-reaching and at least as significant systemic costs imposed by the Rule on the U.S. economy. Past EPA ignores the vital importance of reliable and affordable electricity to consumers. It fails to undertake a proper jobs and employment analysis. Past Agency purports to consider employment impacts, but only in the electricity sector. But does not consider job losses in other sectors due to the Rule and the substantial increases in electricity prices that it will entail. Hence, the effects of higher energy costs are felt most acutely by the poor and other segments of the population at highest risk for the health problems targeted by EPA. The Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin has summarized the available research: &quot;Health in the United States is very strongly correlated with income. Poor people are less healthy than those who are better off, whether the benchmark is mortality, the prevalence of acute or chronic diseases, or mental health.&quot; Ironically, the costs of EPA&#39;s Rule mean that it may aggravate the very respiratory illnesses it seeks to prevent, because poverty is highly correlated with the incidence of those diseases. The American Thoracic Society has opined that &quot;poverty may be the number one risk factor for asthma It is all too easy for people with a humanistic bent and with disdain for the &quot;dismal science&quot; of economics to equate hard-headed cost-benefit analysis with an obsession with allocative efficiency and a disregard for distributive justice.

By reducing our dependence on foreign oil, creating many high-paying jobs, and bringing down the cost of living for U.S. households, increased domestic energy production can protect our national security and provide greater economic stability.  with the various &quot;carbon tax&quot; proposals, is Higher taxes in the form of increased energy costs and reduced wages, relative to the cost of living.  In addition to increasing costs, particularly on middle class and lower income earners. The (Obama ) President&#39;s energy policy was  hyper-focused on picking winners and losers and in handing over taxpayer resources to unproven ideas and technologies that, like windmills,  far too often, are completely unable to compete in the energy marketplace.  I do not believe we should be purposefully stopping or raising the cost of existing and proven energy sources - and adding to the costs of doing business or raising a family in the U.S. - in order to make alternative energy sources more attractive . I think we need to work to ensure that our tax code is designed so that it does not punish the production of any viable energy source. The fundamental question related to BLM&#39;s  is whether we as a nation want to encourage responsible energy development on the vast, multiple-use public lands of the United States, or do we want to shut it down.

Many rule are a broad new regulatory regime with no real justification as it adds cost and delay to energy development with no identified environmental benefit; duplicates yet usurps state regulation; and cannot be implemented in an efficient manner.

In Doing  so,  the  U.S. Would strengthen Its partnerships  in the  region, serving regional  stability and Its global interests.&quot; Similarly,  Anita Orban, Hungary&#39;s Ambassador-at-Large for Energy Security Of the  Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, said That &quot;the United States Can advance its own foreign  policy Objectives with a  new tool which is called energy diplomacy.&quot; In effect, rising American Natural gas exports would lead  to  rising American Global  influence,  a development that these nations welcome. many Asian Nations are highly dependent on  imports  for  their  energy needs,  much Of which comes  from the unstable  Middle  East. For This  reason, the Prospect of  U.S. LNG  Is Especially valued for its stability. For example, Yasushi  Akahoshi, Japan&#39;s  Minister Of Economy, Trade,  Industry  And Energy,  Said that &quot;half Of  the expanded demand  for natural gas is coming from the Middle East,  And  our dependence  on that region is  rising.&quot; He  concluded that &quot;the Import  from  the U.S.  Would  be  the  most reliable supply, which  could bring  about  less  dependency  on the  Middle  East.&quot; Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India&#39;s Deputy  Chief  Of  Mission,  Stated that U.S. LNG Exports &quot;would Provide a steady, reliable supply Of clean  energy and  help  diversify  our imports from Our traditional suppliers.&quot;  It  Should  also  be  noted  that many  of the Nations participating  in  the  forum  have  cooperated with  the  U.S. to  impose Economic sanctions  on  Iran.  Quite  arguably,  American  self-sufficiency  in Natural gas  has  made it  easier  for  these  nations to Do so since they  now are less dependent on Iranian natural gas. Jaroslav Zajicek, Deputy Chief  Of  Mission  For  the  Czech  Republic,  Relayed  similar experiences. He Explained that  the  sharp  drop in U.S. Imports  of natural gas Is already  helping  by freeing  up additional  supplies  from  the Caribbean And other sources that  were  once  destined for The U.S.  But now  serve the  Western  European market. &quot;We  Have already seen  examples where the  Russian negotiating position during  contract-renewal talks  was weakened  thanks  to decreasing prices  on the  markets in Western  Europe,&quot; He said. With regard To the threat of Russian  Supply  disruptions  to the  Czech  Republic, Zajicek Urged  that  &quot;if Supplies  get cut, if  our  security  is  in  threat, we  have  to stand  for  each  other.  U.S.  LNG and  US Hydraulic fracturing Would  benefit  the common security  of  the  whole  transatlantic  family.&quot; Russia  Has  a  history  of  threatening to  cut  off Supply  to  Lithuania  And  other nations and  has  occasionally followed through on those threats. &quot;An  Ability to obtain natural gas from the U.S., even if very small amounts by U.S. standards,  would make a huge  impact  on the Lithuanian Gas  market  and  allow the  nation to develop a reliable alternative  to  Russian gas.",many nation would like add natural gas electricity mix given affordability low emission hydraulic fracturing lng exporting widely seen excellent source new supply geopolitical context benefit diversity apply supplier well gas supply added option new u drilling technology enhances kind diversity especially important central eastern european nation heavily reliant russia natural gas dependence led higher price also ability russia exert political pressure nation october subcommittee energy power hosted forum rene jean jumeau haiti minister delegate prime minister see lng export mean country transition quot aid based relationship trade based relationship quot said quot question energy central every type issue development consider quot jean jumeau added replacing oil haiti currently us generate electricity natural gas would lead quot reduction cost electricity least percent quot would double benefit making electricity accessible citizen haiti majority haitian yet access also ensuring low energy price necessary attract investment manufacturing lng export would serve strengthen kind cooperation ashok kumar mirpuri singapore ambassador united state said quot increased lng export asia would anchor economic presence contribute enhancing region energy security would strengthen partnership region serving regional stability global interest quot similarly anita orban hungary ambassador large energy security ministry foreign affair said quot united state advance foreign policy objective new tool called energy diplomacy quot effect rising american natural gas export would lead rising american global influence development nation welcome many asian nation highly dependent import energy need much come unstable middle east reason prospect lng especially valued stability example yasushi akahoshi japan minister economy trade industry energy said quot half expanded demand natural gas coming middle east dependence region rising quot concluded quot import would reliable supply could bring le dependency middle east quot taranjit singh sandhu india deputy chief mission stated lng export quot would provide steady reliable supply clean energy help diversify import traditional supplier quot also noted many nation participating forum cooperated impose economic sanction iran quite arguably american self sufficiency natural gas made easier nation since le dependent iranian natural gas jaroslav zajicek deputy chief mission czech republic relayed similar experience explained sharp drop import natural gas already helping freeing additional supply caribbean source destined serve western european market quot already seen example russian negotiating position contract renewal talk weakened thanks decreasing price market western europe quot said regard threat russian supply disruption czech republic zajicek urged quot supply get cut security threat stand lng u hydraulic fracturing would benefit common security whole transatlantic family quot russia history threatening cut supply lithuania nation occasionally followed threat quot ability obtain natural gas even small amount standard would make huge impact lithuanian gas market allow nation develop reliable alternative russian gas,0.9976,Positive

Bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including many crop and forest pests. Analyses suggesting that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Bats play an incredibly important role in the ecosystem, eating billions of crop-destroying insects like moths and beetles, as well as mosquitoes. But in just four years, more than a million bats have been killed. The Indiana bat is a temperate, insectivorous, migratory bat.

EPA-HQ-OW-2019-0415-0023,"On behalf of the Family Farm Alliance (Alliance), I thank you for this opportunity to provide input  on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy approaches for addressing baseline issues in watersheds with EPA-approved Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). This is intended to assist policy makers who would like to pursue water quality trading as a regulatory option for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit compliance.<br/><br/>The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts, and allied industries in 16 Western states.  The Alliance is focused on one mission:  to ensure the availability of reliable, affordable irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers.  We are also committed to the fundamental proposition that Western irrigated agriculture must be preserved and protected for a host of economic, sociological, environmental and national security reasons  many of which are often overlooked in the context of other national policy decisions.  The Family Farm Alliance and the farmers and organizations we work with are dedicated to the pragmatic implementation of actions that seek to find a sustainable balance of environmental protection and economic prosperity. <br/><br/>In general, we agree with the approaches and definitions proposed in Section III of EPAs document. We support the revised baseline definition, and believe it will encourage stakeholders to make progress towards meeting water quality standards while allowing credits to be generated without unnecessary delay. We believe additional pollutant reductions from nonpoint sources used to generate credits could also be used to generate reductions to achieve a TMDL load allocation. The incremental baseline approach, employing compliance schedules, the use of Water Quality Standard (WQS) variances, and the concept of an in-lieu fee program proposed by EPA all have merit. These could be useful tools for policy makers and permitting authorities to implement market-based programs, including water quality trading. The EPA also recommends that any alternate approaches that states decide to adopt should be clear, transparent, and demonstrate that the overall planned reductions in the watershed are sufficient to meet the overall TMDL allocations for the watershed. We believe these are viable and appropriate options.<br/>Conclusions<br/><br/>As EPA considers public comments and refines its current proposal, we urge that your agency seek to advance a philosophy that strives to protect those nonpoint sources that are not participating in voluntary water quality markets from being additionally regulated in any way. We need to ensure there are not unintended impacts. We believe Western farming and ranching communities would be supportive of these concepts if EPA clearly shows these concerns are being addressed. <br/>There are only so many ways to restore health to a river, all which center on restoring the form and function of waterways.  Simple actions like planting native trees along streambanks, cover cropping or fencing livestock represent the bulk of these.  Newer, more advanced actions, such as drain water management and saturation buffers, can also improve agricultural production while decreasing water quality impacts. However, complicated funding and permitting processes that are poorly timed against agricultural work windows thwart efficiency. Further, not all conservation is created equal: some sites make a big difference and some, none.  <br/><br/>Western farmers and ranchers can play a key role in using their lands, water and management practices as tools to engage in market-based programs, including payment for ecosystem services (PES) projects. These types of projects can create opportunities for partnerships with landowners, business, NGOs, and agencies that can significantly improve the environment, business climate, and quality of life within Western watersheds. A voluntary system of payments may be more socially acceptable and effective than extensive additional regulation; and help to preserve our Nations ability to produce food and fiber for future generations.  <br/><br/>We appreciate the critical discussion and reflection that EPA is applying to market-based approaches, and stand ready to work with EPA on building that platform and engaging the Western farm and rangelands community about market-based approaches. We believe a well-designed water quality  trading program can make some ranching or farming operations even more financially and environmentally viable.  <br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments to you.

See Water Quality Trading Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, 84 Fed. Reg. 49,293 (Sept. 19, 2019).  <br/><br/>On behalf of Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., I write to express our strong support for the Agency&#39;s efforts to modernize its water quality trading policy. Owned by 900 dairy farm families, Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., is milk marketing cooperative moving nearly 3 billion pounds of milk each year from family farms to the marketplace. The cooperative also operates two consumer products processing facilities and two ingredients processing facilities. <br/><br/>Fifteen years have passed since EPA adopted its 2003 Water Quality Trading Policy. In that time, much has changed. As EPA observes, nonpoint source reduction technologies and practices have developed substantially, along with our ability to understand the impact of those practices on the environment. In addition, while the 2003 Policy was innovative and forward-thinking at the time of its adoption, it has been criticized as confusing and inflexible in certain respects. We agree with EPA that simplified and more flexible approaches to baseline are necessary to facilitate the development of robust water quality trading policies. <br/><br/>Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., substantially agrees with the comments submitted in this docket by Newtrient LLC. Newtrient&#39;s comments are informed by its extensive technical expertise and highlight the ways in which revised EPA policy relating to the &quot;baseline&quot; for credit generation by nonpoint sources in Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) watersheds can foster the development of more robust water quality trading programs. Specifically:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We strongly support the EPA&#39;s February 6, 2019 Memorandum titled &quot;Updating the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) Water Quality Trading Policy to Promote Market-Based Mechanisms for Improving Water Quality&quot; and the six principles announced in that memorandum. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We support allowing nonpoint sources to generate credits for any pollutant reductions the nonpoint source makes that are not included in the assumptions that support the TMDL. It is crucial that EPA&#39;s approach to baseline avoid creating unnecessary barriers to participation such as requiring nonpoint sources to achieve restrictive &quot;sector&quot; allocations prior to generating tradeable credits.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We support the additional flexibility for nonpoint sources to generate tradeable water quality credits under the &quot;incremental baseline&quot; concept proposed by EPA. We further encourage EPA to consider other innovative approaches to address the achievement of TMDL load allocations while encouraging broad participation in water quality trading. <br/><br/>We believe in the ability of market-based mechanisms to incentivize voluntary water quality improvement efforts by landowners and farmers, and we look forward to continued engagement with the Agency as part of the Agency&#39;s important work in this area. <br/><br/>Please contact me at 703-742-6800 or via email jbryant@mdvamilk.com if I can provide further assistance to EPA in advancing this important policy effort. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Jay Bryant, CEO<br/><br/>See attached file(s)",december via regulation govdavid rossassistant administratoroffice wateru environmental protection pennsylvania avenue washington water quality trading national pollutant discharge elimination system program docket id epa hq ow dear mr ross thank opportunity provide comment response environmental protection agency epa agency request comment published september federal register concerning issue associated quot baseline quot water quality trading program see water quality trading national pollutant discharge elimination system fed reg sept behalf maryland amp virginia milk producer cooperative association inc write express strong support agency effort modernize water quality trading policy owned dairy farm family maryland amp virginia milk producer cooperative association inc milk marketing cooperative moving nearly billion pound milk year family farm marketplace cooperative also operates two consumer product processing facility two ingredient processing facility fifteen year passed since epa adopted water quality trading policy time much changed epa observes nonpoint source reduction technology practice developed substantially along ability understand impact practice environment addition policy innovative forward thinking time adoption criticized confusing inflexible certain respect agree epa simplified flexible approach baseline necessary facilitate development robust water quality trading policy maryland amp virginia milk producer cooperative association inc substantially agrees comment submitted docket newtrient llc newtrient comment informed extensive technical expertise highlight way revised epa policy relating quot baseline quot credit generation nonpoint source total maximum daily load tmdl watershed foster development robust water quality trading program specifically strongly support epa february memorandum titled quot updating environmental protection agency epa water quality trading policy promote market based mechanism improving water quality quot six principle announced memorandum support allowing nonpoint source generate credit pollutant reduction nonpoint source make included assumption support tmdl crucial epa approach baseline avoid creating unnecessary barrier participation requiring nonpoint source achieve restrictive quot sector quot allocation prior generating tradeable credit support additional flexibility nonpoint source generate tradeable water quality credit quot incremental baseline quot concept proposed epa encourage epa consider innovative approach address achievement tmdl load allocation encouraging broad participation water quality trading believe ability market based mechanism incentivize voluntary water quality improvement effort landowner farmer look forward continued engagement agency part agency important work area please contact via email jbryant mdvamilk com provide assistance epa advancing important policy effort sincerely jay bryant ceosee attached file,0.9976,Positive

USCG-2003-14273-0012,"Dear Sir or Madam:<br/><br/>I am the Cargo Operations Manager for Sause Bros., a tug and barge company located on the west coast.  We currently have a fleet of 13 ocean going tugs and 20 ocean going barges that operate throughout the Pacific.  Specifically, we are now operating six barges and three tugs between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii while the remainder of the vessels operate along the coast between Canada and Mexico.<br/><br/>Sause Bros is very concerned with the referenced proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to make the voluntary ballast water management program mandatory and applying to all vessels.  We are members of the American Waterways Operators and heartily endorse their position on this issue.<br/><br/>Sause Bros.&#39; barges will not be able to follow the guidelines as written.  Our barges are all equipped with stern ballast tanks which must be utilized during the loading and unloading process.  This process of loading and discharge takes place at coastal lumber mills, port docks along the Columbia River, and alongside public docks in Hawaii.  The guidelines request that ballasting not take place over coral reefs, areas near sewage outfalls, areas near dredging operations, areas where tidal flushing is known to be poor, in darkness, or where propellers may stir up the sediment.  These areas are precisely where our barges load and discharge. <br/><br/>In addition, the NPRM requests that all vessels employ at least one of the following ballast management practices.  <br/>  1.  Exchange ballast water 200 miles from shore.  This is unrealistic and not possible to do (safely) on our unmanned barges.<br/>  2.  Retain the ballast water.  When our barges are empty, all ballast (stern tanks) must be removed so that the barge does not pound on the return trip damaging the bow of the vessel.  New barges could be built to hold the ballast...but the present fleet does not have the capability.<br/>  3.  Use an environmentally sound method of ballast water management approved by the USCG.  We are not aware of any such alternatives.<br/>  4.  Discharge ballast water to an approved reception facility.  There are none...or few.  Also, if there were any facilities, it would be a great expense to truck the water to the facility....since the deballasting for our barges must take place at the discharge location...not at the approved reception facility.<br/><br/>As you can see, our company will have a difficult time trying to comply with the NPRM.....and, indeed, may find that some of the guidelines are impossible to follow.  <br/><br/>We also have concerns with the ballast reporting form.  The form is specific for one vessel.  The tug and barge industry operates in clusters of two or more vessels.  Could the form be specific to a tow which might include one tug and two barges?  This would reduce the paperwork involved while presenting the same information.  Also, the form could be more tug and barge &quot;friendly&quot; using terms and measurements that are common to the industry.  <br/><br/>In summary, our concerns are that the NPRM, as written, seems to be based on deep sea vessels (ships) coming into US waters.  For that purpose it may be acceptable.  However, the tug and barge industry utilizing unmanned, un-powered vessels operating in shallow, tidal waters is unique and does not fit well into the guidelines.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this NPRM.  We hope the Coast Guard and AWO can work together in &quot;fine tuning&quot; the rules on ballast water management before they become law.<br/><br/>",dear sir madam cargo operation manager sause bros tug barge company located west coast currently fleet ocean going tug ocean going barge operate throughout pacific specifically operating six barge three tug pacific northwest hawaii remainder vessel operate along coast canada mexico sause bros concerned referenced proposed rulemaking nprm make voluntary ballast water management program mandatory applying vessel member american waterway operator heartily endorse position issue sause bros barge able follow guideline written barge equipped stern ballast tank must utilized loading unloading process process loading discharge take place coastal lumber mill port dock along columbia river alongside public dock hawaii guideline request ballasting take place coral reef area near sewage outfall area near dredging operation area tidal flushing known poor darkness propeller may stir sediment area precisely barge load discharge addition nprm request vessel employ least one following ballast management practice exchange ballast water mile shore unrealistic possible safely unmanned barge retain ballast water barge empty ballast stern tank must removed barge pound return trip damaging bow vessel new barge could built hold ballast present fleet capability use environmentally sound method ballast water management approved uscg aware alternative discharge ballast water approved reception facility none also facility would great expense truck water facility since deballasting barge must take place discharge location approved reception facility see company difficult time trying comply nprm indeed may find guideline impossible follow also concern ballast reporting form form specific one vessel tug barge industry operates cluster two vessel could form specific tow might include one tug two barge would reduce paperwork involved presenting information also form could tug barge quot friendly quot using term measurement common industry summary concern nprm written seems based deep sea vessel ship coming u water purpose may acceptable however tug barge industry utilizing unmanned un powered vessel operating shallow tidal water unique fit well guideline thank opportunity comment nprm hope coast guard awo work together quot fine tuning quot rule ballast water management become law,0.9783,Positive
USCG-2003-14273-0005,"The &quot;do nothing alternative,&quot; though an important part of any analysis, clearly does not apply with regard to ballast water management based on case history of environmental impacts from past oversight due, in part, to the lack of advanced technological knowledge.  Even the Proposed Action Alternative discribed on page 36 (Table 2) indicates the potential for an adverse environmental impact to organisms due to salinity and temperature.  Perhaps this alternative can be supplemented by the development of an action strategy.  To facilitate this, an inter-agency/interested party telephone conference committee could be coordinated.  In addition, a grant/prize could be awarded to anyone who could remediate the problem.  Even I have two ideas that could revolutionalize the industry, so consider the concerted efforts of the great inventors of the world!  With regard to violations, will there be a &quot;flat fee&quot; or a &quot;weighted fee,&quot; based an amount of ballast water, ship size, or economic considerations?  Of course, incurring a large &quot;flat fee&quot; would be onerous to the small mercant vessel owners and incurring a small &quot;flat fee&quot; may not be worth the associated hastle of compliance to some large vessel operators.  Should a fund supported from violation fees be set up to remediate past and future ballast water-related impact areas?  Should &quot;spot check&quot; surviellance become an intensive routine?  How many repeated violations would lead to further punitive action?  Should these discharges also be regulated by the USEPA  NPDES Program?  Your document claims that you do not plan to hold a public meeting unless an explanation of its benefit is provided.  It has been my experience that the public has played an important role in many of the major developments of all phases of environmental management.  Certainly, the USCG in its newly designated role of support of Homeland Security, can justify holding a public meeting regarding an issue that is definitely in the public interest.

BOR-2008-0002-0004,"January 7, 2009<br/><br/>Ms. Avra Morgan, Mail Code 84-52000<br/>Reclamation of Reclamation<br/>Denver Federal Center<br/>P.O. Box 25007<br/>Building 67<br/>Denver, CO 80225<br/><br/>Re:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Comments on Rural Water Supply Program Interim Final Rule<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>OMB #1006-AA54<br/><br/>Dear Ms. Morgan:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the above referenced rule.  This <br/>important rule will help the Bureau of Reclamation assist and oversee the proper <br/>planning and implementation of rural water projects.  These projects are needed to <br/>deliver adequate and safe drinking water to many in the arid Western US who <br/>currently do not have this basic necessity of life.  We generally support the <br/>provisions within the rule, but there are a few parts we would like to comment on.  <br/>We have organized our comments to follow the format of the Interim Rule.<br/><br/>43 CFR Parts 404.4(c), 404.44(c)(10), and 404.49(d)(8)<br/>We are concerned about the requirement in these sections that the project, &ldquo;&hellip;. <br/>generate national net economic benefits as required under the Economic <br/>Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources&hellip;&rdquo;.  As <br/>discussed with the Overview of the rule, &ldquo;Current data indicate that millions of <br/>Americans still live without safe drinking water, a basic necessity of life.&rdquo;  It is true <br/>that most of the rural water supply projects are needed to protect and insure the <br/>public health and safety of US citizens.<br/>  <br/>We believe that the need to adequately address human health and safety issues <br/>exceeds the strict economic cost/benefit analysis that may be used for a purely <br/>economics driven project such as a crop irrigation project, for example.  We <br/>suggest that the requirement be changed to require that the project sponsor <br/>demonstrate to Reclamation that the proposed project is the most economically <br/>effective approach for meeting the public&rsquo;s health and safety needs.<br/><br/>43 CFR Part 404.13<br/>We agree with the overall set of criteria that have been developed in this part to <br/>prioritize Reclamation funding for projects.  However, we feel that the degree to <br/>which a project addresses public health and safety issues should be weighted <br/>higher than the other criteria within this rule.<br/><br/>43 CFR Part 404.36<br/>There are several existing rural water entities which are not yet authorized by <br/>Congress but have been actively planning their rural water projects.  We are aware <br/>of at least one project that has completed significant planning efforts since the <br/>passage of the Rural Water Supply Act in 2006.  This project has completed its <br/>Appraisal Report with the best intent of meeting all the requirements outlined in <br/>the 2006 Act.  The project sponsor submitted the Appraisal Report to Reclamation <br/>in October 2007, but Reclamation has been unable to review it until their program <br/>and this Rule were finalized.  This project has also initiated efforts on its <br/>Feasibility Report.  <br/><br/>We feel that at a minimum Reclamation should be willing to reimburse 50 percent <br/>of the planning work that has yet to be completed at the time of the funding <br/>application.  This is with the understanding that the final report needs to meet the <br/>requirements of the Rule.  We would also like Reclamation to consider <br/>reimbursement of planning work that has already been completed since December <br/>2006, if the intent of the project sponsor was to meet the requirements of the Rural <br/>Water Supply Act and the final reports meet the requirements of this Rule.  We <br/>feel these reimbursements are necessary to be fair to project sponsors who have <br/>elected to be proactive with their projects and not wait until Reclamation <br/>established its program to administer the Act. <br/><br/>43 CFR Part 404.43<br/>The proposed schedule for Appraisal Report reviews is reasonable.  However, we <br/>request that the review be expedited of Appraisal Reports that have already been <br/>submitted to Reclamation, if possible.  These reports have been awaiting the <br/>implementation of this Rule in order for Reclamation to formally review them.  As <br/>discussed above, certain projects have been awaiting review of their Appraisal <br/>Report and are interested in funding assistance for their Feasibility Report.  Since <br/>Reclamation requires that the Appraisal Report be reviewed and approved prior to <br/>releasing funds for the Feasibility Report, this process will limit the ability of these <br/>project sponsors from realizing the benefits of the program because they have <br/>elected to be proactive with planning efforts.  The degree to which Reclamation <br/>can expedite review of already submitted Appraisal reports will help limit this <br/>impact to entities eligibility for Feasibility Report funding. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

Fairfax Drive, Suite 222<br/>Arlington, VA 22203<br/><br/>RE:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Designation of Critical Habitat for the Louisiana Black Bear<br/><br/>The Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation (LFBF) would like to submit the following <br/>comments regarding the draft economic analysis of impacts associated with the <br/>proposed designation of critical habitat for the Louisiana black bear.  We <br/>commented in opposition to the proposed designation in correspondence dated <br/>July 7, 2008.<br/><br/>As we have stated before, we believe the latest proposal is about compliance with <br/>the courts and control over the land resources, not about the science or needs of <br/>the bear. If it was truly critical the habitat would have been listed long ago.  The <br/>evidence since the listing clearly shows that this additional level of federal control <br/>is completely unnecessary in addressing the needs of the bear.<br/><br/>We have concerns for landowners that fall within the proposed boundaries as well <br/>as adjacent landowners regarding impacts on land use as well as land values.   In <br/>some cases access and drainage could be impacted. Additional concerns <br/>regarding dredging and cleaning of farm and parish drainage systems, road <br/>construction to access forested wetlands, construction of camps or other <br/>structures in forested wetlands were expressed by most landowners.  Although it <br/>was not a primary concern, possible consultations regarding pesticide <br/>registrations in agricultural and forestry uses was an additional concern.<br/><br/>Most of these concerns were either not addressed or were assumed to have little <br/>costs in the draft economic analysis.  Regarding impacts to agricultural, only <br/>impacts to Bee-Keepers were estimated.  No costs were estimated regarding <br/>other crop depredation issues, drainage impacts, possible land use restrictions, or <br/>incremental impacts on land values.  Clearly, it is difficult to assess the <br/>incremental impacts of the proposal.  However, we strongly believe it will costs <br/>farmers and landowners more than just some fencing around bee hives. <br/><br/>While it is difficult to measure how the proposal will be administered into the <br/>future, we believe that the draft economic analysis underestimates the impacts to <br/>agriculture and believe estimates of additional regulatory costs should be <br/>considered.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Ronald Anderson<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>President, LFBF<br/><br/>",december fws e policy directive managementu fish wildlife fairfax drive suite va designation critical habitat louisiana black bearthe louisiana farm bureau federation lfbf would like submit following comment regarding draft economic analysis impact associated proposed designation critical habitat louisiana black bear commented opposition proposed designation correspondence dated july stated believe latest proposal compliance court control land resource science need bear truly critical habitat would listed long ago evidence since listing clearly show additional level federal control completely unnecessary addressing need bear concern landowner fall within proposed boundary well adjacent landowner regarding impact land use well land value case access drainage could impacted additional concern regarding dredging cleaning farm parish drainage system road construction access forested wetland construction camp structure forested wetland expressed landowner although primary concern possible consultation regarding pesticide registration agricultural forestry us additional concern concern either addressed assumed little cost draft economic analysis regarding impact agricultural impact bee keeper estimated cost estimated regarding crop depredation issue drainage impact possible land use restriction incremental impact land value clearly difficult ass incremental impact proposal however strongly believe cost farmer landowner fencing around bee hive difficult measure proposal administered future believe draft economic analysis underestimate impact agriculture believe estimate additional regulatory cost considered sincerely ronald andersonpresident lfbf,0.6486,Positive

FWS-R4-ES-2008-0047-0034,"On behalf of W. Elton Kennedy, WEK Properties, LLC, Fisher Creek, LLC and <br/>Delta Land &amp; Farm Management, Co. LLC, we oppose the Designation of Critical <br/>Habitat for the Louisiana Black Bear proposal for the following reasons:<br/>1.  According to the USFW&#39;s own numbers, the population is increasing at a <br/>healthy rate without the addition of the critical habitat.<br/>2.  Our own personal siteings and experiences confirm an increasing population <br/>with increasing the critical habitat.<br/>3.  The USFW reports that an additional 55,000+/- acres of WRP has increased <br/>the habitat but in the same report, the USFW states that enrollment in the WRP <br/>has decreased.  This decrease is not the fault of landowners but of the USDA as a <br/>result of the appraisal process change that eliminated the WRP program from <br/>competing with agricultural production.  WRP would have continued to increase <br/>acreage if the USDA had kept this program in competition with the market place <br/>and removed conservation programs from the AIG limitations of the Farm Service <br/>Agency.<br/>4.  For the USFW to say that cropland will be exempt except in the case of <br/>federal permit requirements truly places an undue burden on landowners as the <br/>process as it exists today is lengthy, time consuming and burdensome to the say <br/>the least.  The last thing that a landowner needs today is more bureaucratic <br/>paperwork for land that is privately owned.<br/>5.  The USFW recommendation that only timber or habitat less than twelve (12) <br/>acres is exempt fromt the habitat area can be classified as a &quot;Taking&quot; as even <br/>good timber management will be restricted.  <br/>6.  The USFW restrictions placed on oil &amp; gas exploration and pipeline crossings <br/>should also be classified as a &quot;Taking&quot; in that the USFW will be removing the <br/>income potential for minerals from the property thereby decreasing the value and <br/>marketability of the property.<br/>7.  The designation of the critical habitat is in truth a servitude on the property and <br/>is a &quot;Taking&quot;.<br/>8.  There is no compensation offered the landowner for the severe restrictions <br/>placed on the land in the habitat therefore a true &quot;Taking&quot; has occurred.<br/><br/>Summary:  While the USFW should be commended for the success story of the <br/>Louisiana Black Bear, it is not the responsibility of the private landowner to provide <br/>increased habitat for the Black Bear without just compensation for the ability to <br/>just say no.  It is the responsibility of the USFW and USDA to provide voluntary <br/>programs with adequate compensation in order to provide increased habitat for <br/>their own success story.  The private landowner did not ask to increase the <br/>numbers of Black Bear but now he is being asked to provide habitat without due <br/>consideration with an increase in servitudes.  Therefore, the program as presented <br/>is not acceptable.<br/>Lannie B.

FWS-R4-ES-2008-0047-0007,"RE:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Designation of Critical Habitat for the Louisiana Black Bear<br/><br/>The Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation (LFBF) would like to submit the following <br/>comments regarding the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Louisiana <br/>black bear as contained in the May 6, 2008 Federal Register. <br/><br/>This issue has been discussed for some sixteen years in one form or another.  <br/>The Louisiana black bear was originally listed as threatened on January 7, 1992.  <br/>Designation of critical habitat was found to be not determinable at the time of <br/>listing.  Later in December of 1992 the Service proposed critical habitat for roughly <br/>3 million acres.  The Service never published a final rule designating critical <br/>habitat. In September of 2005, Mr. Harold Schoeffler and Louisiana Crawfish <br/>Producers Association &ndash; West filed suit in U.S. District Court regarding the failure <br/>to designate critical habitat.   The Service is now complying with a court approved <br/>settlement agreement to designate critical habitat, if prudent.  If it was truly critical <br/>the habitat would have been listed long ago.  We believe the latest proposal is <br/>about compliance with the courts and control over the land resources, not about <br/>the science or needs of the bear.<br/><br/>The LFBF was and still is opposed to the critical habitat designation.  We are also <br/>concerned that many landowners are not aware of this proposal. The evidence <br/>since the listing clearly shows that this additional level of federal control is <br/>completely unnecessary in addressing the needs of the bear. <br/><br/>The Service stated in the proposal that, &ldquo;Conservation of the Louisiana black bear <br/>will require habitat protection and restoration and, therefore, is dependent upon the <br/>voluntary protection and restoration of privately owned lands.&rdquo;  The <br/>accomplishments since the listing have had a positive impact on the bear.  Do not <br/>ruin the trust of landowners by placing an unnecessary level of federal control over <br/>their lands. The last time critical habitat was proposed some private landowners <br/>stopped cooperating in bear restoration and research efforts. This was due to <br/>concerns over the loss of property rights.  The negative public sentiment and <br/>concerns of property owners should be considered in this designation.  <br/><br/>Even the Service admits the population of bears has increased significantly since <br/>it was listed.  Significant voluntary efforts of private landowners in habitat <br/>restoration have played a major roll in increasing bear populations.  The Service <br/>stated that there is circumstantial evidence that the population is growing.  In <br/>1997 population estimates were between 200 to 400 bears.  While the Service <br/>indicated no current overall estimates are available, they did site older studies <br/>from population ranges.  The Service has published estimates of 400 to 700 black <br/>bears in Louisiana. <br/><br/>LFBF encourages voluntary approaches to address various environmental issues. <br/>We agree with the statement in the proposal, &ldquo;that voluntary conservation efforts <br/>by private landowners are vital for the conservation and recovery of this <br/>subspecies.&rdquo;  Significant progress has been made in habitat restoration for the <br/>Louisiana black bear since listing.  The majority of this has been on private lands. <br/>Approximately 219,459 acres have been enrolled in the WRP program in <br/>Louisiana since 1992.  The Service only listed WRP enrollment at 55,000 acres. <br/>Due to the easements involved, WRP lands will not be reverting back to open land.<br/><br/>The Service is still concerned about future conversion of hardwood tracts to <br/>agricultural uses.  In almost all instances this land resource is not suitable for <br/>agricultural production.  If it was suitable, it would have been converted years ago.  <br/>Additionally, laws protect these lands and regulations such as the U.S. Army <br/>Corps of Engineers&rsquo; Section 404 permit program under the Clean Water Act and <br/>the U. S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s swampbuster and sodbuster provisions <br/>under The Food Security Act. Conversion of forested lands to agricultural uses is <br/>not occurring and will not be occurring in the future.  The only major conversion <br/>occurring is that of agricultural lands to forested lands.  The proposal discusses <br/>the increases in restoration of lands. Since the listing, over 600,000 additional <br/>acres of habitat have been added and are under protection but concerns are still <br/>raised regarding the conversion to farmland. The idea of conversion to farmland <br/>goes totally against all evidence and even the Service&rsquo;s own comments.  <br/><br/>If a species is listed or critical habitat is designated, Section 7 of the Endangered <br/>Species Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, <br/>fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the <br/>species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.  If a Federal action <br/>may affect critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into <br/>consultation with the Service. The Service through consultation can recommend <br/>alternatives to the proposed projects.  Activities that may destroy or adversely <br/>modify critical habitat as determined by the Service could be stopped entirely.  <br/>Actions on private lands that are not federally funded, authorized or permitted do <br/>not require Section 7 consultations.  <br/><br/>Since the U.S. Corps of Engineers, EPA, USDA, FEMA, Federal Highway <br/>Administration, Federal Aviation Administration are all federal agencies that either <br/>permit and fund various activities on both private and public lands, the potential for <br/>consultations within the three critical habitat units consisting of over 1.3 million <br/>acres is great. In the past, the primary activity of concern was the conversion of <br/>forest land to open farm land.  While this activity is non-existent, the proposed <br/>rule would virtually prohibit any future conversion.  Oil and gas drilling; <br/>commercial, industrial and residential development; flood control projects; road <br/>construction; clearing of woody vegetation on easement lands to facilitate <br/>drainage of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers are all activities that could <br/>negatively affect habitat and would be subject to consultation, with the Service <br/>ultimately determining what action would be allowed.<br/><br/>In the past, additional concerns regarding dredging and cleaning of farm and <br/>parish drainage systems, road construction to access forested wetlands, <br/>construction of camps or other structures in forested wetlands were expressed by <br/>most landowners.  Although it was not a primary concern, possible consultations <br/>regarding pesticide registrations in agricultural and forestry uses was an additional <br/>concern.<br/><br/>We are not aware of any current analysis of the economic impacts of the <br/>proposing critical habitat for the Louisiana black bear.   This is required. The <br/>Service indicates they are preparing one.  The results should be made available <br/>before a decision is made. We have concerns for landowners that fall within the <br/>proposed boundaries as well as adjacent landowners regarding impacts on land <br/>use as well as land values.   In some cases access and drainage could be <br/>impacted.<br/><br/>We believe that the Service is exaggerating the potential habitat losses and <br/>should base their decision on what has actually happened. The facts are clear <br/>substantial habitat restoration has occurred as well as bear populations have <br/>increased since the bear was listed.  All of these efforts have occurred voluntarily <br/>without an additional layer of federal bureaucracy.  Newly created conservation <br/>programs and increased funding for on going programs is going to add additional <br/>bear habitat.  There is no need to designate critical habitat for the Louisiana black <br/>bear.  Such a designation will not produce one positive effect for the bear.  It will <br/>only negatively impact the bear by decreasing landowners&rsquo; willingness to help with <br/>restoration efforts.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span

FWS-R4-ES-2014-0046-0089,"On behalf of the forestry stakeholders representing all aspects of forest landownership, management and stewardship we are writing to raise our concerns of the 4(d) language in the proposed rule to list the black pinesnake (BPS) under the ESA as a threatened species, as well as the inclusion of private lands within Critical Habitat Designation (CHD) areas. <br/><br/>While we applaud the USFWS for giving consideration to a well-intended 4(d) rule to help alleviate the concerns over take of the species while conducting certain activities, but from our perspective, as currently written, the rule is too narrow.  The objective of the 4(d) rule should be to encourage forested habitat conditions for the BPS. Endangered and threatened species protection can be more effectively achieved by allowing forest landowners to continue to manage their land in a responsible manner rather than by imposing land use restrictions and penalties, which result in economic disincentive for owning and managing forests.<br/><br/>We request that you adopt the comments submitted by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI) and by Resource Management Service (RMS), copies of which are attached.  <br/><br/>The NCASI comments are valid and are all supported by recent data.<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Available research indicates that black pine snakes use habitats typical of those that result from clearcut harvesting.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Forest structural conditions have a greater influence on BPS habitat selection than the pine species present in<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>the forest overstory.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Proposed Rule presents an incomplete and dated characterization of modern pine plantation management and<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>structure.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Proposed Rule presents forecasts about the rate of forest conversion to other land uses that were based on dated <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>economic assumptions.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Records of BPS are rare, they are difficult to survey, and data describing population trends are not available.<br/><br/>Likewise the comments submitted by RMS support the views of the forestry stakeholder community.

Moreover, with over 400 species awaiting listing decisions, the precedent set with this decision can signal two very distinct directions that the Service will take on this and future listing decisions. RMS strongly encourages the USFWS to use this listing decision to clearly reach out to private forest landowners to be an active partner in conservation of the black pinesnake, and set a very positive precedent for the Service and private forest landowners to work proactively together in the future to benefit conservation of listed and at risk species found in forested habitats.&quot;<br/><br/>In closing, it is imperative that the Service work with Federal agencies, State partners, and forest stakeholders to revise the proposed 4(d) rule. Active forest management has proven to enhance and conserve species by creating a variety of stand conditions, ages, and types over time, providing secure habitat through management rather than by eliminating management.

I understand that this subspecies faces significant challenges in the wild due to the loss of longleaf pine habitat across its range. I would urge the USFWS to consider protections for black pine snakes in the wild that do not affect captive breeding of these snakes and transportation across state lines. This subspecies is popular among captive breeders. It&#39;s numbers in captivity are likely higher than in the wild population due to the efforts of captive breeders. Regulations that hinder the ability of keepers to breed and sell these snakes would  be counterproductive for conservation efforts. They would result in lower overall numbers of black pine snakes. Given the lack of suitable habitat in the wild, captive populations of black pine snake provide an important backup to beleaguered wild populations.

FWS-R4-ES-2014-0046-0046,"I agree that the black pinesnake should be listed as an endangered species. Originally found in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, the snake has not been found in Louisiana in over 30 years and has disappeared from two counties in Mississippi as well. This will obviously continue if they are not better protected. One of the greatest threats to this snake is its rampant habitat depletion. The snake inhabits open longleaf pine forests, and due to fire suppression, timbering, development and other various factors, this habitat has been destroyed and less than 5% of it remains. These longleaf pine forests are also often converted to pine plantations, which is not the snake&acirc;s preferred habitat. An increase in the number of roads in the area further damages their habitat and leads to increased mortality due to drivers. In addition to habitat depletion and fragmentation, slow reproductive rates and predation play a role in the endangerment of the subspecies. Red fire ants and &acirc;urban predators&acirc; also hunt the snake. Although there is state legislation in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana prohibiting the killing or collecting of the black pinesnake, federal action needs to be implemented, which will in turn prevent the depletion of the habitat, protecting the snakes. It is clear that if something does not change the snakes will go extinct, and their Listing Priority Number of 3 reflects that.

I am all for conservation of any animal from the cute and fury, to the beautiful and scaly, but adding this species to the federal list will, for the most part, do nothing more to protect the species than the state lists it currently is on. The major difference would be preventing interstate transport. This would, in turn, affect the number of breeders willing to work with this animal, which would then lead to less captive bred offspring. Most black pinesnakes, if not all, in the reptile trade today are from captive breeding efforts. This captive population could also be what ultimately saves this animal from extinction. What we do in the reptile hobby, is not too far from what zoos do to conserve wild populations of all types of animals. &quot;Conservation through captive breeding&quot; is a phrase and a statement used in the hobby today that many breeders take great pride in. The more we breed in private collections the less will be taken from the wild of all species commonly kept. Causing private breeders to discontinue breeding this precious snake by making it illegal to transport across state lines would diminish captive populations. This in turn could ultimately effect the survival of this species in the wild. Habitat protection and preservation should be the number one concern at this point. Once preserves are secured and restored, this captive population could and should be used to repopulate and bolster the wild population of the black pinesnake.

NOAA-NMFS-2008-0032-0007,"I agree with and support the proposal from the National Marine Fisheries Service <br/>and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to put the black <br/>abalone on the endangered species list.  The black abalone is susceptible to <br/>many harmful threats.  The largest threat to the black abalone is the <br/>disease &ldquo;withering syndrome&rdquo; (also known as abalone wasting disease) which <br/>attacks the abalone digestive tract.  The black abalones basically wither away.  <br/>Their muscular foot, which aids in their movement, wastes away completely and <br/>they consume their own body.  Global climate change and a changing habitat are <br/>creating unhealthful and unfavorable conditions for the black abalone to survive and <br/>reproduce.  Also, fishing and sea otters contribute to the decline black abalone <br/>population, since both the sea otters and the humans, through fishing activities, <br/>are killing them.  The sea otters feed on the black abalones and the fishing <br/>disrupts the abalone population and habitat.  The black abalone should be listed <br/>as endangered so it can be protected from withering syndrome disease, global <br/>warming effects, and fishing and other predators.  <br/>The black abalone will benefit from being put on the endangered species list. <br/>Listing species as threatened or endangered can help to restore populations and <br/>habitats. Although many species remain on the endangered or threatened lists, <br/>several species have regained in numbers and have been delisted (Doremus &amp; <br/>Pagel, 2001).  Listing the black abalone as endangered will hopefully help them to <br/>increase their population so they have a sustainable population and can be <br/>removed from the Endangered Species list.  In the journal article The Effectiveness <br/>of the Endangered Species Act: A Quantitative Analysis it says that with good <br/>recovery plans a species can have a good chance at survival (Taylor, Suckling, &amp; <br/>Rachlinski, 2005).  Once listed, researchers can develop a successful black <br/>abalone recovery plan which will increase the chances of survival.  There are so <br/>many things negatively impacting the black abalone population that listing them <br/>as endangered can only be a positive impact, by helping to protect the small <br/>population that is left.   With a well thought out plan for black abalone recovery the <br/>species could regain its numbers and be on the way to survival.  <br/><br/>Withering Syndrome<br/>Withering syndrome is the largest reason that the black abalone should be <br/>considered endangered. Withering syndrome is a disease caused by a Rickettsia-<br/>like prokaryote (RLP) and it has almost completely eliminated the black abalones <br/>(California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  If nothing is done to protect the <br/>black abalones, then an outbreak of withering syndrome could potentially cause <br/>them to become extinct.   Friedman and Findley (2003) found that the RLP is <br/>found in over 70% of all types of abalones south of San Francisco.  Most if not all <br/>black abalone live south of San Francisco, which according to the study is greatly <br/>affected with the bacteria that causes withering syndrome.  In black abalones <br/>specifically, withering syndrome is killing over 90% of the species (Roach, 2005).   <br/>That is such a large percentage to be affected by the disease that eliminating it <br/>alone will significantly help to increase the black abalone population.  Disease <br/>rates must be taken into consideration when forming plans to help the black <br/>abalones populations (Friedman &amp; Finley, 2003). Black abalones need to be <br/>protected from withering syndrome since it is killing so many of them, but since it <br/>is not directly caused by humans it would be something that is hard to manage <br/>through regulations. Once the black abalone is recognized as endangered more <br/>research can be put into withering syndrome. <br/>Several black abalones have been discovered in San Nicolas Island in California <br/>that are resistant to withering syndrome (Johnson, 2007).  Scientists believe they <br/>are resistant because that area has been exposed to high levels of the disease <br/>and its black abalones have survived due to the high selective pressures (Johnson, <br/>2007).  This information can be very useful in helping to repopulate the black <br/>abalone species especially since disease is the largest threat.  They are trying to <br/>breed these disease resistant abalones so they can release them to help the <br/>abalones&rsquo; survival (Johnson, 2007).   Breeding the black abalones that are <br/>resistant to withering syndrome could be incorporated as a large part of the <br/>recovery plan. The resistant genes and characteristics would get passed on and <br/>more abalones would be able to survive the disease.   <br/>Scientists are researching and developing a treatment for withering syndrome <br/>which could help the black abalone survive to reproduce and increase their <br/>population.  The antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) can be given to abalones to cure <br/>the disease (Johnson, 2006).  It has been used on abalone farms, but the <br/>antibiotic stays in the abalones system for a while so treated abalone cannot be <br/>sold until the antibiotic levels are low enough (Johnson, 2006).  The antibiotic <br/>could be effective in helping the black abalone species.  If abalones are captured, <br/>treated, and then released back into their environments they might be able to <br/>survive and withstand the bacteria that causes withering syndrome (Johnson, <br/>2006).  A study, on the effects the antibiotic oxytetrcycline has on red abalone in <br/>different water temperatures and on the progress of the disease, shows that the <br/>treated abalones had much lower signs of disease, than the untreated abalones <br/>(Rosenblum, Tjeerdema, &amp; Rachlinski, 2006).  This study shows that the <br/>antibiotic does work on curing withering syndrome and could help to protect and <br/>save the black abalone species if they receive the treatments.  Using the <br/>antibiotic and studying the disease resistant abalones could be a big part of the <br/>abalone recovery plan.<br/> <br/>Changes in Climate<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Increased water temperature also causes the bacteria that cause withering <br/>syndrome to spread more rapidly through the black abalone population (California <br/>Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  The warm water allows the bacteria to <br/>survive longer and infect more black abalones than if the water was not as warm <br/>(Johnson, 2006).   As the climate changes and the ocean water gets warmer, <br/>withering syndrome will spread to more northern waters and affect the abalones <br/>that live in those habitats (Roach, 2005).  As the water increases in temperature <br/>even more abalones are put at risk for the Rickettsia-like prokaryote resulting in <br/>disease.  Withering syndrome which already kills so many black abalone will only <br/>spread and increase with the warming of ocean temperatures.   <br/>The increasing ocean temperatures caused by global warming and climate change <br/>affect the black abalone populations.  The water temperature affects the growth <br/>and reproduction of the abalones.  Higher water temperatures have fewer nutrients <br/>which the black abalone need than cooler waters. Also the food that the abalone <br/>eat such as kelp, cannot survive the warmer temperatures so there is less food for <br/>the abalones (California Department of Fish and Game, 2001). The small amount <br/>of nutrients and food found in warmer waters cause fewer abalone to be able to <br/>survive these conditions.  The warmer the water gets the less food and nutrients <br/>there are for the black abalone. The changing environment and habitat causes the <br/>black abalone to have to compete more for food since there is a limited supply. <br/>Other causes of changes in water temperature can be more locally caused. Power <br/>plants that release warm water into the ocean are affecting the black abalone&rsquo;s <br/>habitat as well. In the 1980s, many abalones died in the surrounding waters of the <br/>Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant (Weiss, 2008). Listing the black abalone as <br/>endangered could tighten restrictions on warm water being released into the <br/>ocean.  <br/><br/>Predators of the Black Abalone<br/>Overfishing is a large issue affecting all the different kinds of abalone.  In 1997, <br/>commercial and sporting fishing of abalones in southern California was banned <br/>due to the declining populations (California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  <br/>Many abalones are preyed upon by either humans, through fishing or sporting <br/>activities, or other animal predators, often before they can reproduce.  In addition <br/>to fishing practices humans also disrupt black abalone habitat causing strain to <br/>the species.  Several predators of the abalones are crabs, lobsters, octopuses, <br/>gastropods, sea stars, sea fishes, and mainly sea otters (California Department of <br/>Fish and Game, 2001).  Sea otters are the most common predator for the <br/>abalones.   Increasing sea otter populations have also caused a part in the decline <br/>of the black abalones.  The more sea otters there are the more food they need to <br/>consume.  Since they are eating more and their food source is the abalones then <br/>more abalones are being preyed upon and killed.  If nothing is done to protect the <br/>black abalone then the few members of the species left could become extinct due <br/>to predators alone.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Poaching of black abalones may not be an issue in the United States, but <br/>abalone poaching has become popular in other areas such as South Africa and <br/>some Asian countries (Wines, 2006).  People see abalones as a delicacy and <br/>they can be rather valuable.  Poaching is a large business and is hard to control <br/>(Wines, 2006).  The black abalones should be placed on the endangered list so <br/>they can be strongly protected against poaching and other harmful human <br/>activities.  <br/><br/>Black Abalone Reproduction<br/>Another issue with the black abalone status is the way they reproduce.  The <br/>abalones release their sperm and eggs directly into the water.  In order for them to <br/>reproduce the abalones must be close to each other and not so far spread out to <br/>increase the chances of fertilization to occur, even just three or four feet is too far <br/>(California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  The less black abalone there <br/>are the less likely they are to reproduce since they are spread out more.  The <br/>black abalones need to be protected.  There are so few numbers that they are not <br/>close enough to reproduce successfully.  Abalones reach maturity at around three <br/>years.  Since many black abalones do not survive long enough to reproduce and <br/>the ones that do survive are not close enough to reproduce, the species is <br/>suffering.  It is also hard to recreate the intertidal conditions for the black abalones <br/>to be bred in captivity (Johnson, 2007).   Something needs to be done to increase <br/>the amount of black abalones so they can reproduce successfully on their own, <br/>since it cannot be done in captivity the same way.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Conclusion<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>I believe the black abalone should be listed as endangered under the Endangered <br/>Species Act.  Listing the black abalone as endangered is the only hope for black <br/>abalone survival. Once listed a plan needs to be developed to control black <br/>abalone population and habitat. Since there is already treatment for the main <br/>cause of black abalone deaths, withering syndrome, then a successful recovery <br/>plan should be well attainable.  The information and research that is already been <br/>done about the oxytetracycline antibiotic and the disease resistant black <br/>abalones should be enough to get a good start at recovering and protecting the <br/>black abalone population. Also habitat restrictions and fishing regulations will help <br/>to maintain the few black abalone that are left until the species recover to a <br/>greater number and fuller population. <br/>Black abalone will be better protected from predators, disease, and climate <br/>changes once listed under the Endangered Species Act as endangered. I strongly <br/>encourage that the black abalone join the already listed white abalone on the <br/>endangered species list so it can hopefully be protected and be around for many <br/>years to come.  The black abalone does not have to become extinct; many of the <br/>threats to the black abalone are human introduced.  If we do something now we <br/>can help by reducing the already existing threats and by preventing any new <br/>threats that could develop.

No doubt, the current<br/>population of the species could be much higher had commercial fishing been<br/>curbed at an earlier time,but one would think that the cessation of such<br/>harvesting in California as early as 1993 would yield greater numbers than are<br/>observed today.  Despite the California coastline comprising such a large<br/>portion of the abalone&#39;s habitat, the numbers have not grown since the close of<br/>black abalone fishing.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The abalone&#39;s decline since this time has been largely, and correctly,<br/>attributed to the abalone withering disease.  It has been noted that beyond the<br/>listing of the abalone as an endangered species, procedures to create a<br/>protected habitat have begun.  However, given that the species current decline<br/>can be attributed to the disease, I fail to see how habitat protection or<br/>protection from harvesting could provide benefit to the black abalone.  Rather<br/>than focusing on hollow promises of protection and redundant restrictions,<br/>should there not be a more rigorous investigation into possible ways to mitigate<br/>the harms of the wasting disease?  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Studies suggest that rising water temperatures or any number of other <br/>factors<br/>may contribute to the spread of the disease.  Accepting these studies as true, I<br/>feel that the so called protection being afforded the species could not possibly<br/>yield any real world results in terms of conservation without some form of<br/>parallel program seeking a solution to the spread of the withering disease. <br/>Otherwise, what protection is being provided beyond a convenient habitat in<br/>which the species may become extinct?<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>While protection as an endangered species is no doubt warranted in this <br/>case,<br/>and while the future establishment of a protected habitat for the black abalone<br/>is an important step toward ensuring the survival of the species, these steps<br/>alone will not meet the goals for which they are created.  It is imperative that<br/>this is but the beginning of a multi-step process in reviving the black abalone<br/>population, and not constitute the culmination of efforts to protect the<br/>species.

NOAA-NMFS-2008-0032-0006,"I agree with and support the proposal from the National Marine Fisheries Service <br/>and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to put the black <br/>abalone on the endangered species list.  The black abalone is susceptible to <br/>many harmful threats.  The largest threat to the black abalone is the <br/>disease &ldquo;withering syndrome&rdquo; (also known as abalone wasting disease) which <br/>attacks the abalone digestive tract.  The black abalones basically wither away.  <br/>Their muscular foot, which aids in their movement, wastes away completely and <br/>they consume their own body.  Global climate change and a changing habitat are <br/>creating unhealthful and unfavorable conditions for the black abalone to survive and <br/>reproduce.  Also, fishing and sea otters contribute to the decline black abalone <br/>population, since both the sea otters and the humans, through fishing activities, <br/>are killing them.  The sea otters feed on the black abalones and the fishing <br/>disrupts the abalone population and habitat.  The black abalone should be listed <br/>as endangered so it can be protected from withering syndrome disease, global <br/>warming effects, and fishing and other predators.  <br/>The black abalone will benefit from being put on the endangered species list. <br/>Listing species as threatened or endangered can help to restore populations and <br/>habitats. Although many species remain on the endangered or threatened lists, <br/>several species have regained in numbers and have been delisted (Doremus &amp; <br/>Pagel, 2001).  Listing the black abalone as endangered will hopefully help them to <br/>increase their population so they have a sustainable population and can be <br/>removed from the Endangered Species list.  In the journal article The Effectiveness <br/>of the Endangered Species Act: A Quantitative Analysis it says that with good <br/>recovery plans a species can have a good chance at survival (Taylor, Suckling, &amp; <br/>Rachlinski, 2005).  Once listed, researchers can develop a successful black <br/>abalone recovery plan which will increase the chances of survival.  There are so <br/>many things negatively impacting the black abalone population that listing them <br/>as endangered can only be a positive impact, by helping to protect the small <br/>population that is left.   With a well thought out plan for black abalone recovery the <br/>species could regain its numbers and be on the way to survival.  <br/><br/>Withering Syndrome<br/>Withering syndrome is the largest reason that the black abalone should be <br/>considered endangered. Withering syndrome is a disease caused by a Rickettsia-<br/>like prokaryote (RLP) and it has almost completely eliminated the black abalones <br/>(California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  If nothing is done to protect the <br/>black abalones, then an outbreak of withering syndrome could potentially cause <br/>them to become extinct.   Friedman and Findley (2003) found that the RLP is <br/>found in over 70% of all types of abalones south of San Francisco.  Most if not all <br/>black abalone live south of San Francisco, which according to the study is greatly <br/>affected with the bacteria that causes withering syndrome.  In black abalones <br/>specifically, withering syndrome is killing over 90% of the species (Roach, 2005).   <br/>That is such a large percentage to be affected by the disease that eliminating it <br/>alone will significantly help to increase the black abalone population.  Disease <br/>rates must be taken into consideration when forming plans to help the black <br/>abalones populations (Friedman &amp; Finley, 2003). Black abalones need to be <br/>protected from withering syndrome since it is killing so many of them, but since it <br/>is not directly caused by humans it would be something that is hard to manage <br/>through regulations. Once the black abalone is recognized as endangered more <br/>research can be put into withering syndrome. <br/>Several black abalones have been discovered in San Nicolas Island in California <br/>that are resistant to withering syndrome (Johnson, 2007).  Scientists believe they <br/>are resistant because that area has been exposed to high levels of the disease <br/>and its black abalones have survived due to the high selective pressures (Johnson, <br/>2007).  This information can be very useful in helping to repopulate the black <br/>abalone species especially since disease is the largest threat.  They are trying to <br/>breed these disease resistant abalones so they can release them to help the <br/>abalones&rsquo; survival (Johnson, 2007).   Breeding the black abalones that are <br/>resistant to withering syndrome could be incorporated as a large part of the <br/>recovery plan. The resistant genes and characteristics would get passed on and <br/>more abalones would be able to survive the disease.   <br/>Scientists are researching and developing a treatment for withering syndrome <br/>which could help the black abalone survive to reproduce and increase their <br/>population.  The antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) can be given to abalones to cure <br/>the disease (Johnson, 2006).  It has been used on abalone farms, but the <br/>antibiotic stays in the abalones system for a while so treated abalone cannot be <br/>sold until the antibiotic levels are low enough (Johnson, 2006).  The antibiotic <br/>could be effective in helping the black abalone species.  If abalones are captured, <br/>treated, and then released back into their environments they might be able to <br/>survive and withstand the bacteria that causes withering syndrome (Johnson, <br/>2006).  A study, on the effects the antibiotic oxytetrcycline has on red abalone in <br/>different water temperatures and on the progress of the disease, shows that the <br/>treated abalones had much lower signs of disease, than the untreated abalones <br/>(Rosenblum, Tjeerdema, &amp; Rachlinski, 2006).  This study shows that the <br/>antibiotic does work on curing withering syndrome and could help to protect and <br/>save the black abalone species if they receive the treatments.  Using the <br/>antibiotic and studying the disease resistant abalones could be a big part of the <br/>abalone recovery plan.<br/> <br/>Changes in Climate<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Increased water temperature also causes the bacteria that cause withering <br/>syndrome to spread more rapidly through the black abalone population (California <br/>Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  The warm water allows the bacteria to <br/>survive longer and infect more black abalones than if the water was not as warm <br/>(Johnson, 2006).   As the climate changes and the ocean water gets warmer, <br/>withering syndrome will spread to more northern waters and affect the abalones <br/>that live in those habitats (Roach, 2005).  As the water increases in temperature <br/>even more abalones are put at risk for the Rickettsia-like prokaryote resulting in <br/>disease.  Withering syndrome which already kills so many black abalone will only <br/>spread and increase with the warming of ocean temperatures.   <br/>The increasing ocean temperatures caused by global warming and climate change <br/>affect the black abalone populations.  The water temperature affects the growth <br/>and reproduction of the abalones.  Higher water temperatures have fewer nutrients <br/>which the black abalone need than cooler waters. Also the food that the abalone <br/>eat such as kelp, cannot survive the warmer temperatures so there is less food for <br/>the abalones (California Department of Fish and Game, 2001). The small amount <br/>of nutrients and food found in warmer waters cause fewer abalone to be able to <br/>survive these conditions.  The warmer the water gets the less food and nutrients <br/>there are for the black abalone. The changing environment and habitat causes the <br/>black abalone to have to compete more for food since there is a limited supply. <br/>Other causes of changes in water temperature can be more locally caused. Power <br/>plants that release warm water into the ocean are affecting the black abalone&rsquo;s <br/>habitat as well. In the 1980s, many abalones died in the surrounding waters of the <br/>Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant (Weiss, 2008). Listing the black abalone as <br/>endangered could tighten restrictions on warm water being released into the <br/>ocean.  <br/><br/>Predators of the Black Abalone<br/>Overfishing is a large issue affecting all the different kinds of abalone.  In 1997, <br/>commercial and sporting fishing of abalones in southern California was banned <br/>due to the declining populations (California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  <br/>Many abalones are preyed upon by either humans, through fishing or sporting <br/>activities, or other animal predators, often before they can reproduce.  In addition <br/>to fishing practices humans also disrupt black abalone habitat causing strain to <br/>the species.  Several predators of the abalones are crabs, lobsters, octopuses, <br/>gastropods, sea stars, sea fishes, and mainly sea otters (California Department of <br/>Fish and Game, 2001).  Sea otters are the most common predator for the <br/>abalones.   Increasing sea otter populations have also caused a part in the decline <br/>of the black abalones.  The more sea otters there are the more food they need to <br/>consume.  Since they are eating more and their food source is the abalones then <br/>more abalones are being preyed upon and killed.  If nothing is done to protect the <br/>black abalone then the few members of the species left could become extinct due <br/>to predators alone.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Poaching of black abalones may not be an issue in the United States, but <br/>abalone poaching has become popular in other areas such as South Africa and <br/>some Asian countries (Wines, 2006).  People see abalones as a delicacy and <br/>they can be rather valuable.  Poaching is a large business and is hard to control <br/>(Wines, 2006).  The black abalones should be placed on the endangered list so <br/>they can be strongly protected against poaching and other harmful human <br/>activities.  <br/><br/>Black Abalone Reproduction<br/>Another issue with the black abalone status is the way they reproduce.  The <br/>abalones release their sperm and eggs directly into the water.  In order for them to <br/>reproduce the abalones must be close to each other and not so far spread out to <br/>increase the chances of fertilization to occur, even just three or four feet is too far <br/>(California Department of Fish and Game, 2001).  The less black abalone there <br/>are the less likely they are to reproduce since they are spread out more.  The <br/>black abalones need to be protected.  There are so few numbers that they are not <br/>close enough to reproduce successfully.  Abalones reach maturity at around three <br/>years.  Since many black abalones do not survive long enough to reproduce and <br/>the ones that do survive are not close enough to reproduce, the species is <br/>suffering.  It is also hard to recreate the intertidal conditions for the black abalones <br/>to be bred in captivity (Johnson, 2007).   Something needs to be done to increase <br/>the amount of black abalones so they can reproduce successfully on their own, <br/>since it cannot be done in captivity the same way.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Conclusion<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>I believe the black abalone should be listed as endangered under the Endangered <br/>Species Act.  Listing the black abalone as endangered is the only hope for black <br/>abalone survival. Once listed a plan needs to be developed to control black <br/>abalone population and habitat. Since there is already treatment for the main <br/>cause of black abalone deaths, withering syndrome, then a successful recovery <br/>plan should be well attainable.  The information and research that is already been <br/>done about the oxytetracycline antibiotic and the disease resistant black <br/>abalones should be enough to get a good start at recovering and protecting the <br/>black abalone population. Also habitat restrictions and fishing regulations will help <br/>to maintain the few black abalone that are left until the species recover to a <br/>greater number and fuller population. <br/>Black abalone will be better protected from predators, disease, and climate <br/>changes once listed under the Endangered Species Act as endangered. I strongly <br/>encourage that the black abalone join the already listed white abalone on the <br/>endangered species list so it can hopefully be protected and be around for many <br/>years to come.  The black abalone does not have to become extinct; many of the <br/>threats to the black abalone are human introduced.  If we do something now we <br/>can help by reducing the already existing threats and by preventing any new <br/>threats that could develop. Listing the black abalone as endangered is the first <br/>step in its recovery.<br/>",agree support proposal national marine fishery service national oceanic atmospheric administration put black

TREAS-TRIP-2016-0005-0008,"An attack against the United States on the scale of September 11th, 2001 would cripple many industries that revolve around Wall Street.  We cannot rely on our insurance agencies to cover damages so drastic and unprecedented in their company&#39;s interest.  We must have government intervention in our investment systems in order to have the greatest impact of relief within our devastated community.  Such costs as those experienced on 9/11, which were upwards of 10-13 billion dollars, would absolutely devastate multiple insurance agencies that are trying to cover the damage.  Under 50.1(c) some may argue that this program limits the abilities of insurers and policy makers and other catalysts to be involved on the process, but I argue that limiting the amount of people involved would further speed up and make the process of a disaster more capable of a group considered solution.  With less people involved, it will be much easier for the government assistance to consider the general scope of any possible disaster.  In any case, we should have a centralized system of authority that handle all terrorism insurance claims and make capable those that are below them the ability to handle certain current unobtainable aspects the the insurance claim form.  In 50.2, it states that the they will implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that will authorize the federal insurance office to assist the Secretary of the treasury in the administration of TRIP.  This will help get the capabilities out of TRIP out to the customers who need to purchase it.  It will also help protect Wall Street further from a crippling event like 9/11 since stock market collectively dropped 7.1% altogether and the biggest loss was the S&amp;P index which dropped 11.6% which in total had a $1.4 trillion dollar loss in the 5 day period the stock market was closed.  United Airlines stock dropped from $30.82 per share to $17.50 per share a 42% decline.  This type of collapse will effect me personally because of the investments and retirement programs I have that incorporate Wall Street and I want to make sure that my assets are safe from any type of foreign and ill intended hands.  In order for people to feel safe with keeping their money in Wall Street, we must have programs like these to make sure that everything we have invested is secure with many safety nets.  It is very hard to argue against the spread and distribution of this insurance program and its statutes.

ANI is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt <br/>nonprofit as authorized by IRS Code 501(n).  It holds an AM Best rating of A and insures more than <br/>10,000 501(c)(3) nonprofits in 32 states, which are also its members. It also<br/>has a 20-year track record of providing an extensive array of risk management and loss control <br/>services to these nonprofits to limit any possible harm to our communities.<br/><br/>I am replying to question (1) (d) from the questions concerning captive insurance posed by the <br/>Treasury in its November  10, 2020 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Comments (which I <br/>have reproduced below and then answered) .<br/><br/>(1) With respect to captive insurers:<br/>(d) Whether changes to the Program structure for captive insurers could prevent<br/>policyholders (who may be unable to obtain terrorism risk insurance in the conventional market for <br/>a reasonable price) from obtaining such insurance from captive insurers.<br/><br/>Changes to the Program structure for captive insurers could prevent policyholders from obtaining <br/>terrorism insurance from captive insurers. This problem is especially acute with respect to RRGs <br/>that have unique risk profiles and coverage needs that the commercial insurance market does not <br/>serve well.  In many cases, an RRG is the only way policyholders may obtain basic casualty coverage <br/>and not having access to TRIA for their own RRGs would remove the single source of<br/>terrorism coverage available to them.<br/><br/>To understand why ANI members would be unable to obtain coverage if we did not offer<br/>coverage, it helps to know who they are. Our members are mostly small and medium people serving <br/>nonprofits that help the very people most likely to need help during a crisis like a terrorist <br/>attack or a pandemic. They serve the people who have little or no reserves and who are likely to be <br/>at immediate risk during any type of disruption. As a result, our member-insureds have unique <br/>insurance needs that are not well-served by the commercial insurance markets.<br/>Consequently, they have formed a risk retention group to close the gap left by commercial carriers. <br/>The majority of ANI member-organizations  require insurance coverage for allegations of sexual <br/>abuse. They also require many specialized coverages including for volunteers, commercial auto <br/>insurance for vans and busses transpo1ting people with disabilities driven by employees and <br/>volunteers, as well as hired and non-owned insurance to cover volunteers driving their own cars on <br/>behalf of nonprofits. These exposures are disfavored by commercial insurers.<br/><br/>Nonprofits own RRG, ANI, would be unable to find or afford terrorism coverage in the commercial <br/>reinsurance market.   These organizations, such as homeless shelters, food banks, group homes for <br/>teens, senior centers, already find it difficult to find affordable casualty insurance from <br/>commercial insurance companies.   If these organizations&#39; own RRG had to compete for terrorism <br/>insurance in the commercial market, it would exacerbate the already daunting task of purchasing <br/>reinsurance in the commercial market for these sorts of risk and make getting any type of coverage <br/>for terrorism highly unlikely .  And not having access to terrorism insurance is simply not an <br/>option for these community-based organizations.  Nonprofit organizations that would be needed to <br/>provide essential support to our communities in the event<br/>of a terrorist attack would be unable to purchase terrorism coverage from perhaps the only source <br/>of casualty insurance available to them.  This would leave them without resources to defend <br/>themselves in the event that they were held liable for failing to protect their employees and<br/>clients from such an event.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Congress enacted TRIA following the 911 terrorist attacks to address market disruptions resulting <br/>from the attacks and ensure the continued availability and affordability of property casualty <br/>insurance for terrorism risk.  It is hard to imagine a group that is more deserving of this TRIA <br/>solution than the members of captives formed as RRGs, particular ANI. This has become more <br/>obvious during this COVID pandemic based on the increased needs of the US population for exactly <br/>the services offered by community-based, people serving organizations and other RRG members that <br/>are already disfavored by the commercial insurance market.<br/><br/>We urge you to retain the TRIA program as configured so that organizations like those served by ANI <br/>can have the terrorism protection they need from the only source available to them.<br/><br/>Pamela Davis<br/>Founder, President and CEO<br/>",federal insurance office attention richard ifft room mt department pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc tria reauthorization proposed rule commentsdear mr ifft comment submitted behalf alliance nonprofit insurance rrg ani risk retention group formed captive law vermont ani tax exempt nonprofit authorized irs code hold best rating insures nonprofit state also member alsohas year track record providing extensive array risk management loss control service nonprofit limit possible harm community replying question question concerning captive insurance posed treasury november notice proposed rulemaking request comment reproduced answered respect captive insurer whether change program structure captive insurer could preventpolicyholders may unable obtain terrorism risk insurance conventional market reasonable price obtaining insurance captive insurer change program structure captive insurer could prevent policyholder obtaining terrorism insurance captive insurer problem especially acute respect rrgs unique risk profile coverage need commercial insurance market serve well many case rrg way policyholder may obtain basic casualty coverage access tria rrgs would remove single source ofterrorism coverage available understand ani member would unable obtain coverage offercoverage help know member mostly small medium people serving nonprofit help people likely need help crisis like terrorist attack pandemic serve people little reserve likely immediate risk type disruption result member insured unique insurance need well served commercial insurance market consequently formed risk retention group close gap left commercial carrier majority ani member organization require insurance coverage allegation sexual abuse also require many specialized coverage including volunteer commercial auto insurance van bus people disability driven employee volunteer well hired non owned insurance cover volunteer driving car behalf nonprofit exposure disfavored commercial insurer nonprofit rrg ani would unable find afford terrorism coverage commercial reinsurance market organization homeless shelter food bank group home teen senior center already find difficult find affordable casualty insurance commercial insurance company organization rrg compete terrorism insurance commercial market would exacerbate already daunting task purchasing reinsurance commercial market sort risk make getting type coverage terrorism highly unlikely access terrorism insurance simply option community based organization nonprofit organization would needed provide essential support community eventof terrorist attack would unable purchase terrorism coverage perhaps source casualty insurance available would leave without resource defend event held liable failing protect employee andclients event congress enacted tria following terrorist attack address market disruption resulting attack ensure continued availability affordability property casualty insurance terrorism risk hard imagine group deserving tria solution member captive formed rrgs particular ani become obvious covid pandemic based increased need u population exactly service offered community based people serving organization rrg member already disfavored commercial insurance market urge retain tria program configured organization like served ani terrorism protection need source available pamela davisfounder president ceo,-0.9981,Negative

TREAS-TRIP-2020-0022-0008,"2019 TRIA Reauthorization Proposed Rules Comments<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Executive Summary<br/><br/>The requirement for a cyber attack to be dangerous to life, property or infrastructure means that the most likely route by which a cyber incident overseas could inflict damage in the US would be via an attack against OT which is deployed inside and outside the US. The current terrorist capability to execute this type of attack is limited, but the threat is evolving and the exposure is increasing massively with the adoption of IoT technology. The classification of an act of terrorism could be challenging, and we recommend that TRIA should be informed by the insurance industry&#39;s work on defining what constitutes an Act of War in the context of cyber attack. A further consideration is that the most likely form of harm to the US economy through a cyber event outside the country would be via non-damage business interruption, which would likely not meet the TRIA requirement for danger to life, property or infrastructure. If public-private partnerships such as TRIA are to be relevant to the most harmful impacts of cyber events, they should address losses from non-damage business interruption.  Finally, a case-by-case approach to evaluating damage within the US would add friction and uncertainty to the provision of insurance - a common lexicon of impact would be of great value in creating a common understanding.<br/><br/>Nick Beecroft<br/>CyberCube Analytics Inc.<br/><br/>",tria reauthorization proposed rule commentsexecutive summarythe requirement cyber attack dangerous life property infrastructure mean likely route cyber incident overseas could inflict damage u would via attack ot deployed inside outside u current terrorist capability execute type attack limited threat evolving exposure increasing massively adoption iot technology classification act terrorism could challenging recommend tria informed insurance industry work defining constitutes act war context cyber attack consideration likely form harm u economy cyber event outside country would via non damage business interruption would likely meet tria requirement danger life property infrastructure public private partnership tria relevant harmful impact cyber event address loss non damage business interruption finally case case approach evaluating damage within u would add friction uncertainty provision insurance common lexicon impact would great value creating common understanding nick beecroftcybercube analytics inc,-0.9941,Negative

These comments focus on the Program&#39;s Treatment of Cyber Events Outside the United States, and the Certification Process. <br/><br/>Program&#39;s Treatment of Cyber Events Outside the United States<br/>The NPRM requests comment on whether cyber terrorism attacks originating abroad can cause damage within the United States. Swiss Re believes that such attacks can certainly lead to cyber-related losses within the United States. The definition for act of terrorism requires a damage within the United States but does not require the perpetrators to be physically present in the country. Additionally, Swiss Re believes that insured losses reaching the $5,000,000 threshold and qualifying as &quot;damage within the United States&quot; for the purposes of the Program should be covered to the fullest extent. Lastly, for the purposes of evaluating losses after a cyber terrorism attack, the Treasury should do so by measuring the total claimed damages of terrorism insured losses.<br/><br/>Certification Process<br/>Regarding the NPRM request for comments on the Treasury&#39;s certification process, Swiss Re agrees with the recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Risk Sharing Mechanisms (ACRSM) that a petitioning procedure should be introduced. Swiss Re believes that allowing third parties such as one or more of policyholders, insurers or reinsurers would create a better petitioning process to initiate TRIP coverage. Assuming the petitioner were to claim that the $5,000,000 insured loss threshold was met, the secretary should initiate a review to certify the event and decide if coverage should be provided. In order to meet the requirements of TRIA, petitioners should submit information that provides the dollar amount of the losses relating to the attack. Additionally, petitioners should provide any further information that may help the government decide whether the loss meets the criteria for TRIP coverage. Finally, in respect to the recommendation by ACRSM on time periods and notification requirements, Swiss Re believes that by reducing the time period to 30 days, the market can receive more frequent updates.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments.

TREAS-TRIP-2020-0010-0003,"As described in the attached, Treasury&rsquo;s 2018 report revealed significant compliance risks in the program such as:<br/><br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Up to 29% of policies are issued without an identifiable terrorism premium, although insurers cannot recover from the federal backstop unless they have provided policyholders with a &ldquo;separate line item&rdquo; disclosure; and<br/><br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The terrorism premium insurers reported to Treasury for 2017 may be as much as $1.1 billion short of the actual amount of premium attributable to the risk.<br/><br/>Despite these and other compliance risks, Treasury currently has no tools to investigate or enforce compliance with the program until after an insurance company claims a payout from the backstop. By then it will be far too late for the insurer to fix any compliance issues. Treasury&rsquo;s only recourse at that point is to deny the requested reimbursement and, if appropriate, pursue civil or criminal penalties against the insurer and the company executive signing the certificate of compliance.<br/><br/>This is not a hypothetical risk.  It is playing out right now with certifications signed by executives under another of Treasury&rsquo;s catastrophe relief programs.

Becker<br/>Vice President, Global Issues<br/>and Research<br/><br/>October 30, 2008<br/><br/>Howard Leikin, Deputy Director<br/>Terrorism Risk Insurance Program<br/>Public Comment Record, Suite 2100<br/>Department of the Treasury<br/>1425 New York, Ave., NW<br/>Washington, DC 20220<br/><br/>Re: TRIA Cap on Annual Liability Proposed Rule Comments, 31 CFR Part 50, RIN <br/>1505-AB92<br/><br/>Dear Howard:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments regarding the proposed pro <br/>rata <br/>claims<br/>allocation provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. PCI supports the <br/>Treasury<br/>Department approach of adhering to general insurance industry practices in the <br/>development of this<br/>process. After reviewing the proposed rules, we suggest the following for your <br/>consideration with<br/>regard to workers compensation claims:<br/>&bull; Determine Pro Rata Loss Percentages (PRLPs) under Section 50.92(a) on <br/>a &ldquo;claim&rdquo;, rather<br/>than a &ldquo;policy&rdquo; basis.<br/>o Unlike property insurance policies, workers compensation losses can involve <br/>hundreds<br/>or thousands of claimants from the same event at the same location.<br/>o Workers compensation claims are often, by their nature, &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo; obligations. <br/>Further,<br/>workers injured during the same event may receive partial payments in differing <br/>amounts<br/>or on different schedules.<br/>o Using a &ldquo;policy&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;claim&rdquo;, basis for pro-ration may provide for ease of <br/>auditing<br/>at a macro level.<br/>o However, using a &ldquo;policy&rdquo; basis for proration can produce effective PRLPs on a <br/>claim<br/>basis that are different from the promulgated PRLP. For example, in Scenario 1, <br/>one<br/>claimant receives 92% of the full insured loss, while the other receives just 58%.<br/>o Applying the PRLP on a claim basis would avoid subsidization of some <br/>claimants at the<br/>expense of other workers insured under the same policy.<br/>&bull; Provide additional flexibility for handling partial payments vs. the final claim <br/>settlement<br/>amount under Section 50.93(a).<br/>o &ldquo;Estimated&rdquo; and &ldquo;actual&rdquo; final claim settlement amounts may differ significantly.<br/>o As indicated before, workers compensation claims are often, by their <br/>nature, &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo;<br/>obligations. As indicated in attached Scenario 2, life expectancies can affect the <br/>amount<br/>of estimated settlements.<br/>o However, actual mortality may differ from original assumptions, and produce <br/>unexpected<br/>results. Additionally, the issue is not limited to mortality cases. Similar results <br/>could be<br/>produced by a faster than expected medical recovery and/or an earlier return to <br/>work by<br/>the injured worker.<br/>o These situations may result in unfairness to the insurer if not fully reimbursed <br/>under the<br/>Program.<br/>o Thus we recommend adding the following language: &ldquo;However, in the event that <br/>the<br/>actual final claim settlement amount is less than the most recent estimate, or in <br/>the<br/>event that the most recent estimate is less than the previous estimate, then the <br/>pro rata<br/>share for that loss is the greater of the amount already paid or the amount <br/>computed by<br/>applying the PRLP to the estimated or actual final claim settlement amount.&rdquo;<br/>We look forward to working with you to address these issues.

TREAS-TRIP-2017-0015-0003,"The inability of the Forest Service to thin forests due to overly cumbersome and lengthy environmental processes, increasing frivolous lawsuits filed by certain litigious environmental activist , and a lack of sufficient agency focus on this challenge has led to nearly 60 million acres that are at high risk of deadly and catastrophic forest fires that endanger communities, hurt local economies, destroy land and water quality and release massive amounts of emissions into the atmosphere. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex of old trees, dead bushes, etc, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. If managed wisely, and remove the environmental activists , America&#39;s national forests can provide clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and abundant domestic supplies of wood products and support rural communities and thousands of jobs in the timber industry. Unfortunately, this year&#39;s wildfire season like recent past wildfire seasons, produced several catastrophic fires that have destroyed more than 9 million acres, resulting in the tragic loss of life and property. In many cases, however, it&#39;s possible to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire through proactive, healthy forest management. While factors such as prolonged drought continue to raise the risk of wildfire, it is imperative that the federal government actively address the one issue within its control: hazardous fuels. Unnatural, overgrown, and unhealthy forests increase the risk and intensity of wildfires. Active management; e.g., thinning the forests, helps protect and restore forests while also helping local economies, and creating jobs. Congress should require the costs and benefits of a proposed forest project be weighed against the costs and benefits of doing nothing to address wildfire threats, disease and insect infestation, and their impacts on local water supply, air quality and wildlife habitat. The choice not to manage the forest is a management decision that directly impacts public health. Additionally, the USFS should expedite regulatory analyses for timber salvage after major wildfires and other natural disasters. This will provide the USFS with some of the revenue it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive post-fire reforestation work. improving forest health and reducing wildfire risk, increased active management will generate more revenue for the federal treasury and the critical services provided by counties, and promote job creation and economic growth in counties across the nation. a market-driven approach to forest management projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and increased forest production.

The act required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the &quot;quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity&quot; of information disseminated to the public.<br/>The OMB guidelines  define a number of key terms that are undefined in the IQA, and those definitions have had a significant effect on how the act is implemented. <br/>OMB said &quot;quality&quot; encompasses elements of utility, objectivity, and integrity. The definitions of some of these and other terms are relatively straightforward and noncontroversial. For example, <br/>OMB defined &quot;utility&quot; as the &quot;usefulness of the information to its intended users, and said &quot;integrity&quot; refers to the&quot;security of information  protection of the information from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification.&quot; The definitions of other terms such as &quot;information,&quot; &quot;dissemination,&quot; and &quot;objectivity&quot;  they establish the scope and applicability of the guidelines. Stricter quality standards apply to &quot;influential&quot; information, so the definition of that term is also important.<br/>OMB established the broad scope of the act by defining &quot;information&quot; in the guidelines as &quot;any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form. <br/>Objectivity:  . OMB&#39;s definition of &quot;objectivity&quot; is equally controversial. The guidelines state that objectivity involves both presentation (i.e., whether the information is presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner) and substance (i.e., whether the information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased). OMB indicated that agencies can presume that data are sufficiently &quot;objective&quot; if they have been subject to an independent peer review process (e.g., as used by scientific journals), but a member of the public can rebut this presumption &quot;based on a persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance.&quot;<br/>Influential Information:    Additional IQA obligations apply to scientific, financial, or statistical information that is &quot;influential.&quot; The guidelines define the word &quot;influential&quot; in this context as information that &quot;the agency can reasonably determine&quot; will have or does have a &quot;clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions&quot; when disseminated to the public.<br/>Specifically, OMB said that agency guidelines should &quot;generally require  sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by a qualified member of the public&quot; and would generate similar results.<br/>The PRA also required agencies to manage their information resources to improve the integrity, quality, and utility of information to all users within and outside the agency.&quot; Also already in place were a variety of nonstatutory requirements related to information dissemination (e.g.,OMB Circular A-130 on &quot;Management of Federal Information Resources&quot;). Therefore, the IQA can be seen as an extension of these previous statutory and nonstatutory requirements. report periodically to the Director (i) the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency; and (ii) how such complaints were handled. <br/>IQA and the resultant OMB and agency guidelines would improve the quality of agency science and regulation and force agencies to regulate based on the best science available.<br/>",past administration comply transparency making clean air clean water rule shelby amendment nov omb amend omb circular quot require federal awarding agency ensure data produced award made available public procedure established freedom information act quot foia codified quot shelby amendment quot result change response covered foia request agency required obtain certain type research data grantee provide requester access data information quality act iqa sometimes referred data quality act enacted december section treasury general government appropriation act fiscal year public law act required office management budget omb issue guidance federal agency designed ensure quot quality objectivity utility integrity quot information disseminated public omb guideline define number key term undefined iqa definition significant effect act implemented omb said quot quality quot encompasses element utility objectivity integrity definition term relatively straightforward noncontroversial example omb defined quot utility quot quot usefulness information intended user said quot integrity quot refers quot security information protection information unauthorized access revision ensure information compromised corruption falsification quot definition term quot information quot quot dissemination quot quot objectivity quot establish scope applicability guideline stricter quality standard apply quot influential quot information definition term also important omb established broad scope act defining quot information quot guideline quot communication representation knowledge fact data medium form objectivity omb definition quot objectivity quot equally controversial guideline state objectivity involves presentation whether information presented accurate clear complete unbiased manner substance whether information accurate reliable unbiased omb indicated agency presume data sufficiently quot objective quot subject independent peer review process used scientific journal member public rebut presumption quot based persuasive showing petitioner particular instance quot influential information additional iqa obligation apply scientific financial statistical information quot influential quot guideline define word quot influential quot context information quot agency reasonably determine quot quot clear substantial impact important public policy important private sector decision quot disseminated public specifically omb said agency guideline quot generally require sufficient transparency data method independent reanalysis could undertaken qualified member public quot would generate similar result pra also required agency manage information resource improve integrity quality utility information user within outside agency quot also already place variety nonstatutory requirement related information dissemination omb circular quot management federal information resource quot therefore iqa seen extension previous statutory nonstatutory requirement report periodically director number nature complaint received agency regarding accuracy information disseminated agency ii complaint handled iqa resultant omb agency guideline would improve quality agency science regulation force agency regulate based best science available,0.9964,Positive

Wildfires contain particulate matter, hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and trace minerals. The individual compounds present in smoke number in the thousands. Particulate matter is the principal pollutant of concern from wildfire smoke. these particles are within the fine particle PM2.5 fraction and can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lung and may represent a greater health concern than larger particles. Another pollutant of concern during smoke events is carbon monoxide, which is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of wood or other organic materials. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. <br/>Wildfire was not even in the reports as to cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Total witch hurt.

TREAS-TRIP-2018-0005-0005,"America future is  Natural gas, Northeast, Maryland, Mass, Penn, Ohio, Virginia,  needs more Pipe lines for clean gas to support  LNG export to help with USA Budget, Bring Money back to America to pay debt and put poor families to work. <br/>LNG will  grow strongly in coming years, supported by broad-based demand and the continuing expansion of export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) increasing the availability of gas globally. By 2040, the US accounts for almost one quarter of global gas production, ahead of both the Middle East and CISUS. Growth in natural gas demand is led by increases in world industry and the power sector and gas gaining share as some countries. The increasing accessibility and competitiveness of gas associated with LNG helps to develop new and expanding markets, led by China together with some smaller Asian countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Europe remains a key market, both as a potential &#39;market of last demand&#39; for surplus LNG cargoes and as a key hub of gas .   USA  enhances its position as the world&#39;s largest producer of oil and gas with increasing prosperity of the developing world is a key force shaping economic and energy trends over the next 25 years. Global LNG supplies more than double with around 40% of that expansion occurring over the next five years. Asia and Europe together account for the vast majority of LNG demand by 2040. Europe domestic gas production reduction causing the share of imported gas in total consumption to increase. European concerns about becoming overly dependent on gas exports from Russia. The sustained growth in global LNG  supplies greatly increases the availability of gas around the world, with LNG volumes overtaking inter-regional pipeline shipments in the early 2020s. Oil accounts for nearly two-thirds of the growth in the non-combusted use of energy, with natural gas providing much of the remainder. Growth in natural gas is concentrated in the use of LNG in long-distance road haulage and marine transportation. China is the world&#39;s largest consumer of energy and has been the most important source of growth for global energy over the past 20 years. rise in India&#39;s energy demand is supported by continued robust economic growth. Fastest rate of growth of gas demand is in the transport sector as gas is increasingly used in trucking and marine transport.  US share of global oil production (crude plus natural gas liquids (NGLs)) increases from about 12% today to about 18% by 2040. This is well above Saudi the world&#39;s second largest producer - which has a market share of about 13% by 2040. For natural gas, the US lead is even more pronounced: accounting for 24% of total gas production in 2040. US also remains the world&#39;s largest consumer of gas and second-largest consumer of oil. All of the demand growth comes from emerging economies, driven by rising prosperity, with India replacing China as the primary source of growth. Non-OPEC supply grows by 5 Mb/d, with the US accounting for more than all of the net growth. US liquids production, including natural gas liquids (NGLs), account for two-thirds of the increase in global supply during the first 15 years. US tight oil could grow more rapidly or for longer than projected. US tight oil could potentially grow to around 15 Mb/d by 2030 and remain around that level. Natural gas grows strongly, supported by broad-based demand, strong increases in low-cost supplies, and continuing expansion of supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) increasing the availability of gas globally. natural gas growth is supported by a number of factors: increasing  levels of ndustrialization and power demand (particularly in emerging Asia and Africa);continued coal-to-gas switching (especially in China); and the increasing availability of low-cost supplies in North America.<br/>",america future natural gas northeast maryland mass penn ohio virginia need pipe line clean gas support lng export help usa budget bring money back america pay debt put poor family work lng grow strongly coming year supported broad based demand continuing expansion export liquefied natural gas lng increasing availability gas globally u account almost one quarter global gas production ahead middle east cisus growth natural gas demand led increase world industry power sector gas gaining share country increasing accessibility competitiveness gas associated lng help develop new expanding market led china together smaller asian country pakistan bangladesh europe remains key market potential market last demand surplus lng cargo key hub gas usa enhances position world largest producer oil gas increasing prosperity developing world key force shaping economic energy trend next year global lng supply double around expansion occurring next five year asia europe together account vast majority lng demand europe domestic gas production reduction causing share imported gas total consumption increase european concern becoming overly dependent gas export russia sustained growth global lng supply greatly increase availability gas around world lng volume overtaking inter regional pipeline shipment early oil account nearly two third growth non combusted use energy natural gas providing much remainder growth natural gas concentrated use lng long distance road haulage marine transportation china world largest consumer energy important source growth global energy past year rise india energy demand supported continued robust economic growth fastest rate growth gas demand transport sector gas increasingly used trucking marine transport u share global oil production crude plus natural gas liquid ngls increase today well saudi world second largest producer market share natural gas u lead even pronounced accounting total gas production u also remains world largest consumer gas second largest consumer oil demand growth come emerging economy driven rising prosperity india replacing china primary source growth non opec supply grows mb u accounting net growth u liquid production including natural gas liquid ngls account two third increase global supply first year u tight oil could grow rapidly longer projected u tight oil could potentially grow around mb remain around level natural gas grows strongly supported broad based demand strong increase low cost supply continuing expansion supply liquefied natural gas lng increasing availability gas globally natural gas growth supported number factor increasing level ndustrialization power demand particularly emerging asia africa continued coal gas switching especially china increasing availability low cost supply north america,0.998,Positive

Their prey includes several species of adult insects whose larvae are known to be important agricultural pests, including the corn earworm or cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea).<br/>VALUE OF BATS; as beneficial pollinators Fruit-eating bats are sometimes called the farmers of the tropics because they are incredibly efficient at dispersing seeds. While some bats provide pest control, nectar-feeding pats act as beneficial pollinators. Giant cacti and agave are just two types of plants that depend on bats for pollination, and in the tropics, over 500 different types of tropical plants are pollinated by bats every year. <br/>VALUE OF BATS TO FOREST: They&#39;re especially essential to regenerating clear-cut forests, which requires seeds to be dropped over large, open spaces . <br/>VALUE OF BATS FOR REDUCED PESTICDES , pest suppression services provided by bats ranges from about $12 to $173/acre (with a most likely scenario of $74/acre) in a cotton-dominated agricultural landscape in south-central Texas.

Wildfires are the biggest threat to ozone and humans and has most deaths This week wildfire in North Calif has taken the lives of  over 30  people so far,  Smoke from wildfires  is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles produced when wood and other organic materials burn. The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses such as bronchitis. Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases - and even are linked to premature deaths in people with these conditions. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. Millions of acres of forest and grassland have burned.   Smoke is a complex mixture of carbon dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and trace minerals. The individual compounds present in smoke number in the thousands. Particulate matter is the principal pollutant of concern from wildfire smoke. these particles are within the fine particle PM2.5 fraction and can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lung and may represent a greater health concern than larger particles. Another pollutant of concern during smoke events is carbon monoxide, which is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of wood or other organic materials. Carbon monoxide levels are highest during the smoldering stages of a fire, especially in very close proximity to the fire. As the smoke moves downwind, it becomes more dilute and often more widespread, eventually reaching ground level  into our lakes and rivers, and drinking water. Past practices of  extinguishing every fire has not been followed,  or cleaning brush and old growth, before  the fires start, too much has been concerned  with old growth impacts related to ecosystems, birds, and wildlife, instead of humans in the area, which are  leading to larger, more intense, more frequent wildfires that threaten life, safety, and property. Wildfire smoke can result in significant air quality impacts to public health, particularly for at-risk groups, and impacts to safety and transportation through diminished visibility on roads and aviation corridors. Wildfire smoke also contains significant quantities of respiratory irritants, which can act in concert to produce eye and respiratory irritation and potentially exacerbate asthma.

AFFI members manufacture and distribute frozen foods throughout the United States and globally.<br/><br/>Executive Summary<br/><br/>AFFI is concerned that in the Draft Guidance, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) takes an overly broad view of what constitutes a refusal of inspection.  This is troubling because the consequence of refusing of inspection is that all food from the foreign facility is refused admission into the U.S.  In our view, this is not the right enforcement tool for many of the activities listed in the Draft Guidance.  In addition, we think that an expansive view of &quot;refusal of inspection&quot; is inconsistent with the statute.  Accordingly, we encourage FDA to revise the Draft Guidance to narrow the scope of actions that are a &quot;refusal of inspection&quot; for which the consequence is refusal of admission of all food from the facility.

IRS-2020-0040-0004,"This comment pertains to Prop. Reg. 1.861-20(d)(3)(v)(C) contained in REG-101657-20.  <br/><br/>Prop. Reg. 1.861-20(d)(3)(v)(C) addresses remittances and contributions and provides that the tax book value (TBV) of the assets of the transferor is used to determine the presumed after-tax  income of the taxable unit from which the remittance or contribution was paid, and upon which the foreign tax was imposed.  <br/><br/>In response to this rule as originally proposed in 2019, commentators noted the potential distortive effect of the rule because a large tax book value asset may only generate a small portion of the overall actual income of the taxable unit.  These comments should be reconsidered, and additional context should be considered, specifically with respect to cash held by a taxable unit.  <br/><br/>In many countries, cash generated from the collection of receivables for services or goods provided cannot be immediately distributed by an entity due to corporate law or other legal (e.g., currency) restrictions.  As a result, if a disregarded entity that is a taxable unit generates significant income in a taxable year and holds significant cash over its year end in a bank account with the intent to distribute the cash in the following taxable year, the substantial cash balance, in relation to other assets, is very likely to skew the TBV calculation to the passive category (presumably, the subpart F passive income grouping for interest, dividends, etc.).  Further, this treatment will likely render the foreign withholding tax paid in the following year by the recipient of the distribution as non-creditable by the U.S. shareholder of the CFC, unless the CFC has passive subpart F income in the same separate grouping that exceeds the withholding tax imposed, which is not assured based on current interest rates. In any event, year to year the TBV rule will skew the assignment of the foreign withholding taxes imposed on a distribution of a taxable unit&#39;s cash as the cash distributed in the following year will effectively be replaced by new cash generated from operations in that distribution year that cannot be distributed.  <br/><br/>The above result should be viewed as unacceptable and contrary to the intended policy objective of matching the foreign withholding tax with the income/earnings (i.e., the activities) that truly generated the income/earnings of the taxable unit.  <br/><br/>If the TBV method is retained in the final regulations, an exception should be provided to minimize this result.  Further, if the TBV method is retained, the regulation should be clarified as to whether the TBV of the assets of the taxable unit are, in fact, determined at the beginning and end of the taxable year and averaged, or some other method is contemplated, as well as any exceptions to the general operation of the TBV method under Reg. 1.861-9.  <br/>",comment pertains prop reg contained reg prop reg address remittance contribution provides tax book value tbv asset transferor used determine presumed tax income taxable unit remittance contribution paid upon foreign tax imposed response rule originally proposed commentator noted potential distortive effect rule large tax book value asset may generate small portion overall actual income taxable unit comment reconsidered additional context considered specifically respect cash held taxable unit many country cash generated collection receivables service good provided immediately distributed entity due corporate law legal currency restriction result disregarded entity taxable unit generates significant income taxable year hold significant cash year end bank account intent distribute cash following taxable year substantial cash balance relation asset likely skew tbv calculation passive category presumably subpart passive income grouping interest dividend etc treatment likely render foreign withholding tax paid following year recipient distribution non creditable shareholder cfc unless cfc passive subpart income separate grouping exceeds withholding tax imposed assured based current interest rate event year year tbv rule skew assignment foreign withholding tax imposed distribution taxable unit cash cash distributed following year effectively replaced new cash generated operation distribution year distributed result viewed unacceptable contrary intended policy objective matching foreign withholding tax income earnings activity truly generated income earnings taxable unit tbv method retained final regulation exception provided minimize result tbv method retained regulation clarified whether tbv asset taxable unit fact determined beginning end taxable year averaged method contemplated well exception general operation tbv method reg,0.9893,Positive

IRS-2020-0040-0029,"The application of Reg. 1.1502-13(c) to intercompany payments involving foreign branches should be further clarified.  The example in the existing regulations does not seem to take into account 1.1502-13(b)(2) which operates to limit the intercompany item taken into account under 1.1502-13(c) to the amount of an intercompany payment received, for example, for services performed on a cost plus basis, to margin generated by the service provider (i.e, the plus portion of the cost plus payment).  It is unclear in the regulations whether the rule in the regulations was drafted to ignore Reg. 1.1502-13(b), or whether that regulation should be considered.  <br/><br/>The rule in the foreign branch reattribution rules that posits the hypothetical as to how a regarded payment would be allocated and apportioned if the payment were regarded should be clarified.  Currently, the rule instructs taxpayers to apply the principles of Reg. 1.861-8 through -14T and Reg. 1,861-17 (without exclusive apportionment).  In considering an intercompany payment for R&amp;D services that is required to be taken into account under Reg. 1.1502-13, or a disregarded payment for such services, it would be helpful to illustrate through an example the application of &quot;the principles&quot; of Reg. 1.861-17.  The example could clarify whether Reg. 1.1502-13(b) is considered, as well as the amount and source of reattribution income, and the interaction of such income with the allocation and apportionment of the R&amp;D expenses of the group.  Because of the significance of R&amp;D expenses for taxpayers, and the prevalence of intercompany or disregarded cost plus payments for such services, an example in this context would be extremely helpful.  In addition, in this context it would be useful for the regulations to address the amount of R&amp;D expenses of a consolidated group that are subject to Reg, 1.861-17 when an intercompany cost plus payment is made by a member to a foreign branch of another member.",application reg intercompany payment involving foreign branch clarified example existing regulation seem take account operates limit intercompany item taken account amount intercompany payment received example service performed cost plus basis margin generated service provider plus portion cost plus payment unclear regulation whether rule regulation drafted ignore reg whether regulation considered rule foreign branch reattribution rule posit hypothetical regarded payment would allocated apportioned payment regarded clarified currently rule instructs taxpayer apply principle reg reg without exclusive apportionment considering intercompany payment amp service required taken account reg disregarded payment service would helpful illustrate example application quot principle quot reg example could clarify whether reg considered well amount source reattribution income interaction income allocation apportionment amp expense group significance amp expense taxpayer prevalence intercompany disregarded cost plus payment service example context would extremely helpful addition context would useful regulation address amount amp expense consolidated group subject reg intercompany cost plus payment made member foreign branch another member,0.4447,Positive

As currently proposed, the rules would apply to a foreign company seeking to send its first shipment, even just samples, to the United States.  A foreign supplier seeking to enter the U.S. market is likely to hesitate to incur these costs before it has established a customer base in the United States.  It is more likely to refrain from entering the market or to abandon it if its customer base is small.  The result would be decreased competition, resulting in higher prices, and loss of choice by U.S. consumers.  It might violate free trade agreements to which the United States is a party.<br/><br/>Basing the exemption on a firm&#39;s U.S. sales would put foreign firms on an equal playing field.

FDA-2011-N-0143-0292,"Dear Sirs/Madams,<br/><br/>Regarding FMSA, Im going to have only two comments I have as for revised proposals and 3 more questions for the entire flame work.<br/><br/>Two comments;<br/>1) Regarding the revised proposals, Id like you to allow the definition of very small company, this time less than 1mil USD, to have further revisions. Japan would like to repeatedly ask that definition of a very small business should adopt the actual export value to US, not the total global sales.<br/>We think it is more reasonable in light of the possible risk to the US consumers, because risk to US customers is more proportionate to the amount of food imported into the US than the global sales.<br/><br/>2) Besides, regulations seem to require sample shipments for trade shows such as business matching to meet the requirements by taking sample test and so on. <br/>Id like to confirm to you if such sample shipments are permitted to be exempt, exceptions, because meeting all the requirements of FSMA would be challenging for small businesses that are willing to test-market for a new product in the US for the first time.<br/><br/>Here are 3 more questions for the entire flame work.<br/><br/>- Firstly,  its about accreditation of the third party shown by FSMA 307 on last July. On this Sep, we didnt have this regulation revised. So we want to know if this regulation will have revised proposal and the status of your reviewing on this regulation.<br/><br/>- Secondly,  its just about if we are supposed to have the guidance to clarify what HACCP program food companies should have. Unlike seafood, process of foods varies in ways of controlling those risks. It seems like challenging to show the correct common standards to control the risks of various foods. We think in order to ease food companies anxieties, it will be nice FDA have the minimum of requirements which food companies should meet over how to control the risk of their processed foods. What do you think about that?<br/><br/>- Lastly,  this is not directly related to revised proposals though. As Japanese companies concern with inspection to their facilities, Id like to ask you on this occasion. We have seen some cases where FDA has inspected manufactures of foods, such as candies or dried foods, which are not usually considered high risk in Japan. This is just about your inspection. What I want to know is how you are now choosing inspected facilities.<br/><br/>Thank you very much.

FDA-2011-N-0143-0265,"Timing of Re-audit or Audit Frequency<br/>I agree that the GOAL for inspections should be within 1 year of the date that the onsite audit would have been required to be conducted; however this 1 year timeline has some real practical limitations.  Oftentimes, the scheduling of the audit is not solely determined by the Supplier (Domestic or Foreign), and is limited by auditor availability and scheduling by the Food Safety Audit Firm.  We Suppliers have to work with what we can get.  This sometimes means that we have a re-certification audit that is after the anniversary date.  Starting in 2015 with SQF there is a 30-day window for audit scheduling around (plus/minus) the anniversary date - this could translate to a re-certification audit being done up to 30 days after the anniversary date.  Then add the standard up to 42 days post-audit to receive the renewal documents from the Audit Firm, and now we have potentially 72 days after the anniversary date that a Supplier would have credible evidence that their food safety audit was conducted and that their food safety system remained enforced.  Simply because a food safety certificate has expired does not mean that a Supplier&#39;s food safety system has been turned off.  Normally the food safety system continues to run even without the valid certificate.  The Supplier should not be penalized for something that is out of their control!<br/><br/>With USDA NOP regulations, this issue was resolved by adopting that an organics certificate is considered valid until withdrawn usually up to 18 months after the issue date.  So clearly the US government has established a precedent.  Perhaps 18 months post-issue-date is a bit too long for food safety.  So how about 15 months post-issue-date as a mandatory requirement for timeline of renewal for food safety.  That timeline under current rules with Audit Firms would work.  And if this option cannot be adopted, then FSMA needs to regulate the Audit Firms to have them to change the way they do business.  That is to eliminate the rules for potential post-anniversary date audits, or to have Audit Firms reduce the amount of days post-audit to review audit results and return back to the Supplier - or a combination of both.  Also, Audit Firms could issue a one page document to the Supplier on the day of the audit acknowledging that the audit was completed and that the Supplier&#39;s food safety system was without any critical findings and thus remains in &#39;good standing&#39;.  This would give the Supplier evidence that their audit was done.  Of course, a Supplier would still need to later collect &amp; file the final audit results that would be later coming from the Audit Firm.  This should then be made an acceptable best practice within the Food Industry.<br/>",timing audit audit frequencyi agree goal inspection within year date onsite audit would required conducted however year timeline real practical limitation oftentimes scheduling audit solely determined supplier domestic foreign limited auditor availability scheduling food safety audit firm supplier work get sometimes mean certification audit anniversary date starting sqf day window audit scheduling around plus minus anniversary date could translate certification audit done day anniversary date add standard day post audit receive renewal document audit firm potentially day anniversary date supplier would credible evidence food safety audit conducted food safety system remained enforced simply food safety certificate expired mean supplier food safety system turned normally food safety system continues run even without valid certificate supplier penalized something control usda nop regulation issue resolved adopting organic certificate considered valid withdrawn usually month issue date clearly u government established precedent perhaps month post issue date bit long food safety month post issue date mandatory requirement timeline renewal food safety timeline current rule audit firm would work option adopted fsma need regulate audit firm change way business eliminate rule potential post anniversary date audit audit firm reduce amount day post audit review audit result return back supplier combination also audit firm could issue one page document supplier day audit acknowledging audit completed supplier food safety system without critical finding thus remains good standing would give supplier evidence audit done course supplier would still need later collect amp file final audit result would later coming audit firm made acceptable best practice within food industry,0.9899,Positive

Does the information have practical utility? Response: Yes to both parts. The industry recognizes that submittal of performance indicator information is necessary for NRC to properly implement the Reactor Oversight Process. The NRC uses this performance indicator data and other inputs to help decide on the level of regulatory response appropriate to the licensees performance at a site.<br/><br/>Question 2: Is the burden estimate accurate? Response: Yes. The NRCs estimates are consistent with our own estimates of the burden imposed by the subject performance indicator data reporting.<br/><br/>Question 3: Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected? Response: None identified. NEI and other representatives of the U.S. nuclear industry meet with counterparts at the NRC several times per year to discuss aspects of the Reactor Oversight Process, including the reporting of performance indicator data. These meetings provide adequate opportunity to discuss industry concerns with or suggestions to improve the quality, utility and clarity of the information collected.<br/><br/>Question 4: How can the burden of the information collection be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology? Response: The data collection and submittal process appears to be as automated and efficient as it can be. To the best of our knowledge, all affected power reactor licensees utilize the NRCs process for electronic submission of performance indicator information. This process appears to present as little burden as practical given the NRCs legal requirements for submittal of official information that potentially affects regulatory decisions.<br/><br/>If you have any questions in this matter, please contact me without hesitation.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>James E.

USCBP-2008-0111-0003,"To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comment regarding the interim final rule on the <br/>Prohibition and Conditions for Importation of Burmese and Non-Burmese Covered Articles of <br/>Jadeite, Rubies, and Articles of Jewelry Containing Rubies and Jadeite.<br/><br/>Overall, the rules outlined in the Federal Register, Volume 74. No. 11 (January 16, 2009) <br/>accurately convey the language in the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, HR 3890/Public <br/>law 110-286, which amends the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, in regards to <br/>jadeite and rubies mined or extracted from Burma and jewelry containing jadeite or rubies mined <br/>or extracted from Burma. This legislation and its subsequent enforcement will effectively deny <br/>the military regime in Burma of funds earned from the sale of gemstones that have assisted the <br/>military government in their ongoing campaign of terror against the people of Burma. <br/><br/>Recommendation 1- <br/>US Note 4(a), Chapter 71, HTSUS, &quot;provides that if an importer chooses to enter any good (or <br/>withdraws such good from warehouse for consumption) under 7103, 7113, or 7116 HTSUS, the <br/>presentation of this entry at the time of importation shall be deemed to be certification by the <br/>importer that any jadeite or rubies contained in such good were not mined or extracted from <br/>Burma.&quot;<br/><br/>It is recommended that, to support this certification, importers should be required, at their sole <br/>expense, to conduct random spot checks utilizing lab testing conducted by an independent <br/>gemological laboratory accredited by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to confirm the <br/>veracity of their certification of non-Burmese origin and to maintain records showing a history of <br/>this auditing process as a matter of due diligence. Records pertaining to this laboratory testing <br/>should be maintained for a period of at least (5) five years and should be made available to CBP <br/>or other enforcement agencies upon request.<br/><br/>Recommendation 2- <br/>Under Section 3A(c)(1) of the BFDA, the &quot;condition for importation is that the exporter of the <br/>non-Burmese covered article has implemented measures that have substantially the same effect <br/>and achieved the same goals as the measures described in section 3A(c)(2)(B)(i) through (iv).&quot; <br/>CBP has amended the regulations &quot;to require that, at the time of importation into the United <br/>States, the importer have in his possession a written certification from the exporter (&ldquo;exporter&rsquo;s <br/>certification&rdquo;) certifying that the jadeite or rubies were not mined or extracted from Burma, with <br/>verifiable evidence from the exporter that tracks the jadeite and rubies&quot; from the mine onward. <br/>This amended language is a very workable solution to help assure non-Burmese origin of <br/>imported jadeite and rubies.<br/><br/>It should be required of the importer that, to claim due diligence regarding their obligation to <br/>insure non-Burmese origin and to meet the minimum requirement to qualify as &ldquo;verifiable <br/>evidence&rdquo;, only government-validated certificates of origin should only be accepted from the <br/>country in which the jadeite or ruby is mined or extracted, providing the system of administration <br/>within the source country issuing such certification can fulfill all requirements stated in HR3890. <br/>There is anecdotal evidence related to alleged offers from non-US gemstone exporters to issue <br/>false documentation that would appear to meet minimum CBP requirements under the <br/>assumption CBP would be unable to verify the validity of these exporter certifications. Lacking <br/>any regulatory oversight over the standards regarding the issuance of the exporter documents <br/>could create an enforcement issue for CBP.<br/><br/>It is further recommended that any protocols related to the issuance of exporter&rsquo;s government-<br/>validated certification that guarantees non-Burmese origin should require random spot testing <br/>conducted by an independent gemological laboratory accredited by US Customs and Border <br/>Protection (CBP) to verify non-Burmese origin. Such testing should be at the sole expense of <br/>the exporter.<br/><br/>Recommendation 3- <br/>Section 3A(d)(1) allows for the re-importation of jadeite, rubies, or jewelry containing jadeite or <br/>rubies into the United States that &quot;are re-imported into the United States after having been <br/>previously exported from the United States, including those that accompanied an individual <br/>outside the United States for personal use, if they are re-imported into the United States by the <br/>same person who exported them, without having been advanced in value or improved in <br/>condition by any process or other means while outside the United States.&quot;<br/><br/>As a condition for export with the intent of re-importation, it should be a requirement that any <br/>exported Burmese-covered article is detailed in such a way (including item count, carat weight, <br/>dimensions, reason for export, and any other relevant details) on any CBP documentation that it <br/>will insure the identical article is the one considered for re-importation.<br/><br/>It should be required that with any non-Burmese covered jadeite or rubies exported for re-<br/>importation, upon re-importation the original Country of Origin Certificate would need to be <br/>included, plus a statement detailing any transformation that has occurred.<br/><br/>Recommendation 4- <br/>Section 3A(d)(2) allows for &quot;the importation of jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from a country <br/>other than Burma and articles of jewelry containing jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from a <br/>country other than Burma, that are imported by or on behalf of an individual for personal use and <br/>accompanying an individual upon entry into the United States.&quot;<br/><br/>There is a risk that an individual could interpret this language as a potential means to circumvent <br/>the sanctions by assuming the claim of &ldquo;personal use&rdquo;, either for themselves or as a carrier <br/>working on behalf of another individual, would exempt them from any regulations pertaining to <br/>the import of covered articles. It is recommended that increased scrutiny be placed on <br/>individuals claiming a &ldquo;personal use&rdquo; exemption and that random spot testing be conducted to <br/>verify the imported articles are in fact non-Burmese. In addition, it should be emphasized that <br/>this &ldquo;personal use&rdquo; exemption only applies to non-Burmese covered articles with no exception.<br/><br/>Recommendation 5-<br/>The legislation specifically requires &quot;a system of verifiable controls on the jadeite or rubies from <br/>mine to exportation demonstrating that the jadeite or rubies were not mined or extracted from <br/>Burma, and accompanied by officially-validated documentation certifying the country from which <br/>the jadeite or rubies were mined or extracted, total carat weight, and value of the jadeite or <br/>rubies.&quot; <br/><br/>Reliance on a &ldquo;paper-only&rdquo; system without any built-in safeguards to verify authenticity and <br/>accuracy of documentation is ill advised, as the opportunity for fraud exists. The &ldquo;system of <br/>verifiable controls&rdquo; should include a requirement for random spot lab testing.<br/><br/>Recommendation 6- <br/>It should be required that importers provide a written warranty to each buyer or ultimate <br/>consignee of non-Burmese jadeite or rubies and jewelry containing jadeite or rubies, affirming <br/>that an established system of verified controls from the mine to the supplier is in place and that <br/>officially-validated certification has accompanied the articles at all stages. Any warranty issued <br/>by the importer cannot rely solely on &ldquo;personal knowledge&rdquo; as sufficient evidence or proof of <br/>&ldquo;verifiable evidence&rdquo; in fulfilling obligations regarding verification of non-Burmese origin as stated <br/>in section 3A(c)(2)(B)(i) through (iv).<br/><br/>Recommendation 7- <br/>Under section 3(c)(1) of the BFDA, &quot;a specific condition for importation of non-Burmese covered <br/>articles it that the importer of non-Burmese covered articles maintain for a period not less than <br/>(5) five years from the date of entry of the non-Burmese covered article a full record of, in the <br/>form of reports or otherwise, complete information relating to any act or transaction related to the <br/>purchase, manufacture, or shipment of the non-Burmese covered article. The importer is further <br/>required to produce such information to the relevant United States authorities upon request.&quot;<br/><br/>The gemstone industry has, in the past, reported to have a &ldquo;five year supply&rdquo; of ruby from Burma <br/>in existing inventory in the United States. The requirement for the maintenance of verifiable <br/>records related to the mining, importation, and exportation of non-Burmese covered articles for a <br/>minimum of (5) five years should be maintained.<br/><br/>Economic Effects-<br/>Enforcement of the aforementioned rules pertaining to the prohibition of Burmese jadeite and <br/>rubies will prove to be an effective tool as part of the US government&rsquo;s efforts to enforce <br/>effective and targeted sanctions against nations that have committed agriegious human rights <br/>violations. In 2001, the Burmese regime was officially earning less than US $20 million at the <br/>government run gem auctions. In a six-year period, they have shown a 28x increase in revenue <br/>from this valuable natural resource. (Officially reported at US $562 million in 2007.) <br/><br/>The regime itself holds a majority share in every mining project in Burma. Partners in the mine <br/>are often senior government officials or close allies. They include Myanmar-Tagaung Company <br/>(a subsidiary of Hone Pan Company) owned by United Wa State Army (UWSA), described by <br/>the US State Department as the &quot;most heavily armed narco-traffickers&quot;, and Htoo Trading <br/>Company owned by U Tay Za, a well-known arms dealer and close accomplice of Senior <br/>General Than Shwe. Villages in the area of the mining operations have been forcibly relocated <br/>by the military as part of efforts to control gem resources. To quote Soe Myint, a leader in exile <br/>of detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi&#39;s National League for Democracy, &ldquo;Most of the <br/>gems are mined by government firms, or those affiliated with the junta, the generals&#39; relatives <br/>and cronies...Whether it&#39;s jade, rubies or sapphires, locals cannot mine them anymore&hellip;. The <br/>local people have nothing else to do because all the land has been confiscated by the <br/>government and government companies.&quot;<br/><br/>Because the civilian population is often nothing more than exploitable (often unpaid, forced <br/>and/or child) labor, they receive very little direct income from the legitimate gem trade in Burma <br/>and any negative effect on them will be negligible. It is over four decades of corrupt and violent <br/>rule by Burma&rsquo;s generals that has caused the hardships facing the people of Burma, not any <br/>sanctions directed solely against the brutal leaders of the regime.<br/><br/>Conclusion-<br/>CBP is on the front lines of enforcement of trade prohibitions and is critical to the success of the <br/>JADE Act. The interim final rule provides an excellent platform that offers both very workable <br/>and realistic means to uphold the law as written and to support the spirit of the law drafted by the <br/>US Congress. <br/><br/>I have complete and total confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of CBP in enforcing <br/>import regulations and maintaining secure borders. My company offers our full support to any <br/>CBP efforts related to this issue and commends your agency for your ongoing work.

Edward Peartree: <br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to provide comment to the Department of State regarding the International Traffic in Arms Regulations: U.S. Munitions List Categories VIII and XIX.  posted on February 9th, 2016<br/><br/>Comments on Proposed Amendments:<br/>The efforts of the current export control reform are a crucial part of moving forward into an updated and efficient export market economy while maintaining national security. I understand there are many considerations that drive each individual decision to amend the regulations. In-flight refueling technology is a crucial part of military operations presently and it is important that these remain as part of the USML. However, paragraph a(9) and paragraph a(12) could be combined into paragraph a(9) because these aircrafts contain technologies that are compatible with one another. While they should both remain on the USML, without the technology for the aircrafts that allow for them to receive the fuel in-flight there would not be a need for the aircrafts capable of refueling aircrafts in the air.<br/>If combining paragraphs a(9) and a(12) is not to be considered then I would recommend that paragraph a(12) be moved directly after paragraph a(9) shown as a(10) and the paragraphs after be moved down subsequently to a(11) and so on. <br/><br/>I thank the Department of Commerce for allowing the opportunity to comment on the amendments and I encourage the DOC to consider this comment, while a small recommendation, I believe that it would take a step in the right direction toward simplifying this part of the regulation without creating confusion.<br/>",march docket id comment amendment international traffic arm regulation munition list category viii xix february dear mr edward peartree appreciate opportunity provide comment department state regarding international traffic arm regulation munition list category viii xix posted february proposed amendment effort current export control reform crucial part moving forward updated efficient export market economy maintaining national security understand many consideration drive individual decision amend regulation flight refueling technology crucial part military operation presently important remain part usml however paragraph paragraph could combined paragraph aircraft contain technology compatible one another remain usml without technology aircraft allow receive fuel flight would need aircraft capable refueling aircraft air combining paragraph considered would recommend paragraph moved directly paragraph shown paragraph moved subsequently thank department commerce allowing opportunity comment amendment encourage doc consider comment small recommendation believe would take step right direction toward simplifying part regulation without creating confusion,0.9754,Positive

NOAA-NMFS-2017-0021-0008,"Overfishing should be protected against. This rule seems to want undermine the protection of fisheries. For example, the status of witch flounder should remain &quot;overfished&quot; not changed to &quot;unknown&quot;. The peer panel and the Council seemed to agree that that there was some evidence of overfishing. The paragraph that advocates for the status being changed to unknown (section 2 &quot;Status Determination Criteria for Witch Flounder&quot;, paragraph 7) is strangely written:<br/><br/>&quot; The witch flounder stock was previously listed as &quot;subject to overfishing&quot; and &quot;overfished&quot;. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Ok, historical precedent for overfishing label remaining.<br/><br/>Despite the rejection of the recent stock assessments for stock status purposes and lack of numerical estimates of stock size, <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- True. These were rejected as mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>there is qualitative information in the assessment that supports continuing to list the status as overfished, <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Ok. So, despite some disagreements about methodology for determining whether or not witch flounder is overfished, everyone seems to agree that there is enough evidence to continue listing witch flounder as overfished. That seems obvious since the fishing mortality rate and the stock biomass and fishery landings and survey catches all indicate that witch flounder are suffering from overfishing. This seems reasonable and necessary.<br/><br/>but changing the overfishing status from &quot;subject to overfishing&quot; to &quot;unknown&quot;. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Wait, what? We were keeping the status as overfished!<br/><br/>The conclusion that the stock is at historical low levels and other signs of poor stock condition, provide reliable indicators that support this stock remaining listed as &quot;overfished&quot;.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Yes<br/><br/> Unlike the &quot;overfished&quot; status, for which we have reliable indicators of stock condition, we do not have reliable indicators for the &quot;overfishing&quot; status. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Ok, so they don&#39;t know how to tell if the witch flounder is actively being overfished.<br/><br/>While we cannot specify an &quot;overfishing&quot; status determination criterion for this stock, catch for the last five years has been below the ACL.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- An important reason for witch flounder to be listed as overfishing or overfished. Something that indicates that the fish are not doing well. <br/><br/> The lack of reliable indicators, the rejection of the recent stock assessment, and the fact that catch has remained below the ACL, support changing the overfishing status of this stock to unknown.&quot;<br/>   - But there is a problem with listing a fish&#39;s status as unknown. As we see in paragraph 5 of this same second section, <br/><br/>&quot; If the status determination criteria are changed to unknown, however, there would be no measurable and objective standards in place against which to judge the status of the witch flounder stock.&quot; No objective standards are a problem! Couldn&#39;t the fishing industry rewrite standards to favor overfishing? It thus makes sense when: &quot;We propose disapproving the Council&#39;s recommendation, and maintaining the existing criteria until a valid assessment model is available to use for setting new catch limits or for generating new criteria. This is new guidance to the Council, provided after it took final action on Framework 56, and is different than the approach the Council has taken, and that we have approved, for recommending status determination criteria for other groundfish stocks with rejected assessments (e.g., GB yellowtail flounder).&quot; <br/>   - There should absolutely be criteria developed.<br/><br/>In any and every situation, overfishing should remain illegal and those laws should be enforced. Ecosystems need to be carefully monitored and controlled. Fish are not just important to American industry, they are important to America&#39;s environment and both will win if overfishing is avoided. <br/><br/>",overfishing protected rule seems want undermine protection fishery example status witch flounder remain quot overfished quot changed quot unknown quot peer panel council seemed agree evidence overfishing paragraph advocate status changed unknown section quot status determination criterion witch flounder quot paragraph strangely written quot witch flounder stock previously listed quot subject overfishing quot quot overfished quot ok historical precedent overfishing label remaining despite rejection recent stock assessment stock status purpose lack numerical estimate stock size true rejected mentioned earlier qualitative information assessment support continuing list status overfished ok despite disagreement methodology determining whether witch flounder overfished everyone seems agree enough evidence continue listing witch flounder overfished seems obvious since fishing mortality rate stock biomass fishery landing survey catch indicate witch flounder suffering overfishing seems reasonable necessary changing overfishing status quot subject overfishing quot quot unknown quot wait keeping status overfished conclusion stock historical low level sign poor stock condition provide reliable indicator support stock remaining listed quot overfished quot yes unlike quot overfished quot status reliable indicator stock condition reliable indicator quot overfishing quot status ok know tell witch flounder actively overfished specify quot overfishing quot status determination criterion stock catch last five year acl important reason witch flounder listed overfishing overfished something indicates fish well lack reliable indicator rejection recent stock assessment fact catch remained acl support changing overfishing status stock unknown quot problem listing fish status unknown see paragraph second section quot status determination criterion changed unknown however would measurable objective standard place judge status witch flounder stock quot objective standard problem fishing industry rewrite standard favor overfishing thus make sense quot propose disapproving council recommendation maintaining existing criterion valid assessment model available use setting new catch limit generating new criterion new guidance council provided took final action framework different approach council taken approved recommending status determination criterion groundfish stock rejected assessment gb yellowtail flounder quot absolutely criterion developed every situation overfishing remain illegal law enforced ecosystem need carefully monitored controlled fish important american industry important america environment win overfishing avoided,0.1179,Positive

OCC-2021-0001-0063,"We oppose the merger!  The bank acquisition target is a profitable community oriented bank that has made significant commitments to grassroot groups and a severely underserved market -- the City of Detroit.  In contrast, the acquiring Bank&#39;s business model in underserved markets has been to outsource and offload engagement to national and regional intermediaries. <br/>This disconnect has resulted in significant credit deserts throughout its footprint, but has resulted in a lack of institutional understanding regarding the lending, investment and service requirements of underserved markets.  This combined with the proposed CRA rule that allows banks to &quot;fail&quot; to meet the needs of LMI geographies within their assessment areas portends a future significant decline in service within its foot print.  <br/><br/>This view is reinforced by Huntington&#39;s proposed closing of branches in Detroit.  This action and strategy to move more activity online, belies the reliance of many residents particularly the elderly and low income families on physical branches. Moreover, it may portend a more Machiavellian  strategy to restructure its service area through attrition.   In addition, Huntington Bank&#39;s lack on institutional capacity in understanding metrics that drive underserved markets led them to be a leading contributor of a heavily subsidized mortgage product that had a minimum FICO threshold higher than that of FHA in Detroit -- a market with a median FICO that is below 560! <br/><br/>In addition, this merger will also eliminate an avenue of access to one of the best Federal Home Loan banks in terms affordable lending, grants and advance rates --  Des Moines.  FHLB Cincinnati is far less active in supporting affordable housing and offers advance rates that are consistently higher than its sister bank.

Huntington has not proven to be any different. With each merger, they promise to commit millions/billions of dollars for low-to-moderate income communities, yet based on their most recent CRA Performance Evaluation, largely Black and Latino populated cities with high levels of low-to-moderate income census tracts show that Huntington Bank has received a POOR Lending Rating for Home Purchase, Refinance and Home Improvement as proven from this excerpt taken from Huntington Banks most recent performance CRA evaluation for the Detroit MD.

With each merger, they promise to commit millions/billions of dollars for low-to-moderate income communities, yet based on their most recent CRA Performance Evaluation, largely Black and Latino populated cities with high levels of low-to-moderate income census tracts show that Huntington Bank has received a POOR Lending Rating for Home Purchase, Refinance and Home Improvement as proven from this excerpt taken from Huntington Banks most recent performance CRA evaluation for the Detroit MD.

NCUA-2021-0072-0008,"I believe this proposed rule is convoluted in its intentions and may have some unseen (or at least unintended) consequences. The opt-in for participation in CCLUR requirements is the first thing which I find convoluted. If large (so called &#39;complex&#39;) credit unions are able to opt-in, and as a consequence, can remain out of this program, what exactly is the point of the regulation in question? An opt-in provision presumably, counteracts a basic tenant to which I believe all regulation must follow: regulations ought to apply to an entire population and distinctions between entities being regulated must only be made in relation to the subject area of the regulation. In this context, the barrier of a &#39;complex&#39; credit union is acceptable as this proposed rule deals with the internal financials of a credit union and therefore a credit union&#39;s total asset valuation is an acceptable, and indeed necessary, distinction. The opt-in provision, by contrast, creates two populations of credit unions based on nothing but the compliance of internal actors of the unions. If the United States government is going to spend time and money on this regulation, if the National Credit Union Administration is going to spend limited resources pursuing this intervention in the affairs of large credit unions (presumably to advance its mission to &quot;ensure the safety and soundness of federally insured credit unions&quot;, why should it create an arbitrary distinction based on compliance. Surely more safety and soundness could be found in a regulation which applied to all large credit unions regardless of a willingness to opt-in. That said, I do agree with the substance of this regulatory proposal. Requiring credit unions to abide by precautionary principles by maintaining a healthy buffer of capital is essential to the overall health of the economy. While credit unions are by nature smaller than and hold less assets than traditional banks, there is still a significant population of Americans whose financial lives are managed and secured by these institutions. In the event of financial crisis, a run on credit unions, while unlikely to tank the entirety of the economy, would still have vast and devastating consequences for their members. Depository institutions, which hold people&#39;s money secure, must have a buffer of capital to provide stability in times of crisis. Beyond this nationwide view, large credit unions also serve an important purpose in the communities from which they draw their membership. Those unions large enough to sustain assets of over $500 million are certainly large enough to affect the nationwide financial climate, but the effects that illiquidity of deposits could have on members of a smaller community are disturbing to consider. Imagine a credit union serving a population along the Front Range here in Colorado. This fictional credit union has enough members and assets to qualify as &#39;complex&#39;. Despite this, this credit union only counts in its membership ranks a small percentage of the total population of Colorado. If it was unable to meet the demands of withdrawals, this might not even budge the national financial radar, but it would certainly make waves locally. The same applies to credit unions serving teachers, firefighters, police and service members. Any hit to the national economy is dwarfed by the specific impacts to these populations. In this, I agree with and salute this policy. I only wish that the opt-in provision would be scrapped in favor of a more uniform, fair and universal standard.

NCUA-2021-0072-0006,"Members 1st Federal Credit Union has been monitoring the proposed changes to risk-based capital for several years, including modeling the proposed risk-based capital calculation utilizing current financial statement data to ensure compliance when the ruling becomes effective.  Through this modeling process the Credit Union has seen favorable results, signifying that the Credit Union will not have issue complying with the risk-based capital standard.  As a result, the Credit Union disagrees with the Boards opinion that qualifying complex credit unions should not opt out of the CCULR framework.  Additionally, the Credit Union believes the Board should allow the same flexibility provided to community banking organizations regarding the ability to decide at the organizational level which calculation is appropriate for the institution, and that permission from the NCUA should not be required due to the demonstrated appropriate level of due diligence performed by the Credit Union.<br/><br/>The Credit Union is not in favor of the proposed simplified approach under the CCULR methodology, and would plan to opt-out of this requirement in favor of the risk-based capital calculation.  A process for compliance has been built and tested over several years, and it is the opinion of the Credit Union that this is a better representation of the financial strength of the organization.  Utilizing the risk-based capital calculation instead of the simplified CCULR approach allows the Credit Union to execute specific balance sheet strategies to promote growth of the Credit Union.  <br/><br/>Specifically related to Question 13, the Credit Union would plan to opt out of the simplified CCULR requirement indefinitely, and as a result would not plan to switch between the methods.<br/><br/>The proposed rule that would provide a simplified measure of capital adequacy for federally insured, natural-person credit unions by opting into the complex credit union leverage ratio (CCULR) framework is overly prescriptive, insufficiently flexible, and operationally restrictive.  In exchange for a more simplified measure of net worth, the credit union must abide by a rigid framework under the CCULR that does not generalize well for credit union&rsquo;s with well-managed, differentiated financial services which are required to meet the sophisticated needs of diverse membership.  This one-size-fits-all approach is manifested in the materially higher minimum net worth ratio of 10.00% in the CCULR framework which imposes significant opportunity costs on capital deployment and creates a wider margin of safety that is superfluous.   The high opportunity cost of capital and the attendant restrictions in operational flexibility exceed the benefit of a more simplified measure of capital adequacy.  Moreover, current net worth measures assess capital adequacy with greater specificity and precision while allowing credit unions to carefully pursue bespoke balance sheet strategies that promote capital formation along a stable trend according to their unique environments and membership.  In short, the proposed rule that would provide a simplified measure of capital adequacy under the CCULR framework is too broad and must therefore impose overly restrictive limits to accommodate all credit unions of various size, complexity, and operations.  Current capital adequacy measures are superior in measuring risk and balancing the cost and benefit of macroprudential regulation.<br/>",member federal credit union monitoring proposed change risk based capital several year including modeling proposed risk based capital calculation utilizing current financial statement data ensure compliance ruling becomes effective modeling process credit union seen favorable result signifying credit union issue complying risk based capital standard result credit union disagrees board opinion qualifying complex credit union opt cculr framework additionally credit union belief board allow flexibility provided community banking organization regarding ability decide organizational level calculation appropriate institution permission ncua required due demonstrated appropriate level due diligence performed credit union credit union favor proposed simplified approach cculr methodology would plan opt requirement favor risk based capital calculation process compliance built tested several year opinion credit union better representation financial strength organization utilizing risk based capital calculation instead simplified cculr approach allows credit union execute specific balance sheet strategy promote growth credit union specifically related question credit union would plan opt simplified cculr requirement indefinitely result would plan switch method proposed rule would provide simplified measure capital adequacy federally insured natural person credit union opting complex credit union leverage ratio cculr framework overly prescriptive insufficiently flexible operationally restrictive exchange simplified measure net worth credit union must abide rigid framework cculr generalize well credit union rsquo well managed differentiated financial service required meet sophisticated need diverse membership one size fit approach manifested materially higher minimum net worth ratio cculr framework imposes significant opportunity cost capital deployment creates wider margin safety superfluous high opportunity cost capital attendant restriction operational flexibility exceed benefit simplified measure capital adequacy moreover current net worth measure ass capital adequacy greater specificity precision allowing credit union carefully pursue bespoke balance sheet strategy promote capital formation along stable trend according unique environment membership short proposed rule would provide simplified measure capital adequacy cculr framework broad must therefore impose overly restrictive limit accommodate credit union various size complexity operation current capital adequacy measure superior measuring risk balancing cost benefit macroprudential regulation,0.9983,Positive

NOAA-NOS-2019-0033-1639,"Dear Mr. Schmahl,<br/> <br/>As a nationwide organization who informs and mobilizes citizens around ocean protection efforts, we have significant concerns around the all-too-brief opportunity to comment on the now-obsolete Regulatory Impact Review (RIR) document and on new opportunities for the Proposed Expansion of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS). The petroleum industry influence on this boundary expansion clearly needs to be revisited in light of new policy priorities and national leadership. The current climate crisis requires science-based cost-benefit approaches that consider the full impact and footprint of oil and gas activities; approaches which prioritize maintaining the biological integrity throughout our National Marine Sanctuaries.<br/> <br/>The Inland Ocean Coalition supports the Alternative 5 boundary expansion, and we are confident that, after objective re-evaluation, Alternative  5 will be found to best meet the criteria outlined in the Sanctuary&rsquo;s 2016 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS).<br/> <br/>As you may be aware, no prior action taken by the National Marine Sanctuary System appears  to have offered such a short 15-day public comment period. Further, we find  it troublesome that the RIR was not circulated along with prior documents supporting the expansion. Regardless of the subpar comment period and the lack of circulated documents, we see this as an opportunity to revisit earlier expansion proposals, which may be more protective of the incredibly fragile ecosystems found in the Gulf of Mexico. Given the circumstance, we note that the National Marine Sanctuary Program must now revisit prior well-documented boundary expansion options &ndash; options that do not undermine the scope of protections being considered for the unique ecosystems found throughout the Gulf region.<br/> <br/>As with all National Marine Sanctuaries, the FGBNMS should not be considered a political captive of the offshore oil and gas industry. Framing the expansion of the Sanctuaryas a detrimental reduction in the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;recoverable oil and gas reserves&rdquo; is wholly inaccurate, and does not consider the impact of COVID-19, Saudi and Soviet oversupply in the global oil marketplace, and the economic downturn experienced in 2020. This means that the RIR&rsquo;s theory that some portion of what is claimed to be 0.11 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) of reserves, 3.86 MMBOE of contingent resources, and 4.50 MMBOE of undiscovered resources is no longer an accurate portrayal. Resources not worth exploring for - or developing - due to low resource prices, cannot be considered economically recoverable. In short, the RIR needs to be revisited and revised, its calculations redone, and new, updated, conclusions determined by its authors.<br/> <br/>Needless to say, the petroleum industry is endangering marine biodiversity, marine resources, and ecosystems of national significance found within the existing FGBNMS. Further, the 15-day public comment period undermines the integrity of public input on this significant national decision..

NOAA-NOS-2019-0033-1635,"NOAA (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) has long represented a progressive and inspiring voice in the scientific world. I believe their action to expand the Flower Garden Banks Marine Sanctuary proves their dedication to the protection and well-being of the natural world. Yet due to an oversight on the inclusion of the Regulatory Impact Review their proposition is once again under review for the public. Yet when provided with this new information, specifically the lack of impact economically with this proposed expansion, I as a common citizen, am only more in favor. I believe it is essential to consider the economic impacts of changes such as these yet it is believed that the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico will not be negatively impacted. In an ideal world, we would find a more sustainable method than oil drilling yet I understand that in order to satisfy both sides compromise must be met. Thus I believe if oil and gas companies will see minimal effects and NOAA is able to expand its sanctuary that it is a compromise worthwhile until further action can be taken.

NOAA-NOS-2019-0033-1640,"The main plank in the Republican party platform is hypocrisy. That&#39;s why GOP politicians wear flag pins even as they try to undermine democracy, specifically its foundation of free elections.<br/><br/>Trump decisively lost the 2020 election. Decisively. He lost the electoral votes 306 to 232, a margin that he called a &quot;landslide&quot; in 2016. And he lost by over 7 million individual votes. But Trump and the GOP can&#39;t accept this result, because they only believe in democracy when their wins. Otherwise they&#39;re willing to burn it to the ground.<br/><br/>Since the election Team Trump has filed dozens of frivolous lawsuits against counties and states. The more recent suits request invalidating the election results for entire states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Actually they&#39;re much more stupid than that, as they only want to throw out the presidential election (which Trump lost) while keeping the down ballot races where the GOP did well. And of course they request giving Trump all of the electoral votes for states that he lost by tens of thousands of votes.<br/><br/>While the Team Trump clown car holds dozens of sore loser conspiracy theorists I want to give a shout out to GOP attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton. On behalf of Texas he is suing four other states because he doesn&#39;t like the way they ran their elections. This is under a novel* legal theory that the way one state runs its elections can harm another state.

I am with the overwhelming majority of the stakeholders that want strong protection for the biologically sensitive and ecologically important deep-sea coral and benthic communities. Very little of the ocean bottom in the Gulf of Mexico has significant natural hard structure that enables coral communities to thrive.
